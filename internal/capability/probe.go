	// should work: wpad-mesh-openssl is installed, wpa_supplicant is running and
	// opens a control socket for the interface, and `iw phy` declares
	// `#{ managed } <= 16` alongside the APs on one channel. The interface comes
	// up in Client mode at channel 0 with 0 dBm, `iw link` says "Not connected",
	// and a scan returns zero BSSes.
	//
	// Isolated properly rather than guessed at: it fails identically with a
	// hand-written UCI section and no controller involved, WITHOUT `wds` as well
	// as with it, and with every AP on that radio disabled so the station is
	// alone. So it is not the controller, not 4-address framing, and not a
	// concurrency limit — station mode does not work on that radio.
	//
	// NOT recorded as a Quirk, deliberately. A quirk here would gate the feature
	// off, and one board is not a driver: this could be that board, that
	// firmware build, or ath10k generally, and the three send an operator to
	// three different places. What it does instead is refuse to let Present be
	// read as a promise — see the note.
