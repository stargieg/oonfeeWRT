// Package collector is the poll loop: it asks each adopted device for its state
// on a schedule, and hands the results to a sink.
//
// Every number in here comes from DEVICE-BUDGET, which comes from measurement
// on a real device, and the package exists to make those numbers structural
// rather than advisory. The rules it enforces:
//
//   - Two rates. Baseline ~60 s always; focused ~5–10 s only while someone is
//     looking at that device. When the last viewer leaves, it drops back.
//   - One request per poll. Batched, because a 60 s poll never reuses its
//     connection — uhttpd drops keep-alive at 20 s — so an unbatched call costs
//     a whole handshake.
//   - Stagger, don't stampede. Ten devices at 60 s is one request every 6 s.
//   - Back off on evidence, and fail quiet. A struggling router must not be
//     hammered by its manager.
//   - Never poll during an apply.
//
// The device computes nothing. It returns raw state and every derivation
// happens here, on hardware that has cycles to spare.
