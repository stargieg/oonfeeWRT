# Where this project is

Written 2026-08-13 as a handoff, and rewritten as the work moved. Current
through **2026-08-23**, with the earlier Phase-3 hardware endpoint in §5bg, the
schema-15/16 source-only checkpoint in §5bh, the read-only live schema-16
Phase-4 pass under the retained router ACLs in §5bi, the superseded no-change
checkpoint in §5bj, the corrected Phase-4 runtime/recovery checkpoint in §5bk,
and the fresh-start/schema-17 release boundary in §5bl/FS-120. Sections
through §5ax record the earlier
committed/hardware baseline; §5ay is product research, §5az is the two-router
no-install capability pass, §5ba records the post-audit behavior, §5bb the
operation-safety pass, §5bc the function-selection cycle, and §5bd is the
directional-policy/class-C gate; §5be is the gateway proof, §5bf the live
schema-14 migration, §5bg its cleanup endpoint, §5bh the source checkpoint at
that time, §5bi the signed-in schema-16 screen pass, §5bj the superseded
no-change checkpoint, §5bk the Phase-4 completion boundary, §5bl the historical
schema-17 live/release validation boundary, §5bm the source-only Phase-4.1
Dashboard/speed-test checkpoint, §5bn the historical schema-19 store foundation,
§5bo the account/RBAC/log foundation, §5bp the stored-diagnostics and
online-backup foundation, §5bq the encrypted portable backup/restore source
closure, and §5br the historical live schema-19 upgrade closure. The active
release boundary at the start of §5 is final schema-19 `v0.1.0`; gateway-run
speed testing is deferred.

This handoff records source, hardware, and release evidence.
[`v0.1.0-rc.1`](https://github.com/aiden0rchad/oonfeeWRT/releases/tag/v0.1.0-rc.1)
was published by the tag-triggered workflow and independently re-downloaded for
the clean, zero-device verification recorded in FS-119. The post-release
SQLite-sidecar hardening in FS-120 is newer than that immutable tag and is
included in the final schema-19 source. The completed `v0.1.0` tag workflow and
GitHub Release are authoritative for final publication.

## 0. Picking this up

Read §5 first — it opens with what to do next, in order. Then §5g, then §6.

To get running:

```bash
npm --prefix ui install && npm --prefix ui run build && go build -o oonfeewrtd ./cmd/oonfeewrtd
./oonfeewrtd -data-dir "$PWD/.run" -listen 127.0.0.1:8080
```

It prompts for an operator passphrase (twice on first run) and serves the UI at
that address. §7 has the unattended variant and everything else operational.

To run the tests:

```bash
go test ./internal/...
```

And the UI:

```bash
npm --prefix ui test
```

The hardware suite needs the device and a credential — §7 explains the rotation
dance, which is the one genuinely fiddly part of this repo:

```bash
OONFEE_TEST_HOST=192.0.2.1 OONFEE_TEST_USER=oonfeewrt OONFEE_TEST_PASS=...   go test -tags=integration ./internal/... -timeout 25m
```

**Two devices, both factory-reset, freshly adopted and live-validated through
2026-08-22 (§5bl and the fresh-start log):**

| | WRT3200ACM | Archer C6 v2 (US) |
|---|---|---|
| address | gateway management alias | AP management alias; DHCP off, static |
| identity | TOFU-pinned gateway identity; exact identifier retained locally | TOFU-pinned AP identity; exact identifier retained locally |
| SoC / target | mvebu/cortexa9 — **class A** | ath79/generic — **class C** |
| selected functions | **Gateway + AP + Switch** | **AP + Switch** |
| radios | mwlwifi ×2 | ath10k (5G) + ath9k (2.4G) |
| firmware | OpenWrt 25.12.5 | OpenWrt 25.12.5 |
| mesh | **gated off** (driver quirk, §5q) | **Present**, verified working |
| access payload | one ACL file + one scoped rpcd login; no package/service | one ACL file + one scoped rpcd login; no package/service |
| applied managed state | two reviewed WLAN sections | two reviewed WLAN sections |
| optional footprint | `libcap`, `libevent2-7`, `lldpd`; controller-managed `lan1`–`lan4` selection | `libcap`, `libevent2-7`, `lldpd`; controller-managed `eth0.1` selection |
| airtime-split | absent (dead counters) | **Present** — only device with it |
| LLDP source | **Observed** on `lan1`–`lan4` | **Observed** on `eth0.1` |
| wired layout | DSA `lan1`–`lan4`; `lan3` is the measured AP downlink | `eth0.1` LAN bridge member; WAN unused |
| gateway evidence | active WAN default; LAN DHCP authority | no active WAN default; LAN DHCP disabled |
| health | online, both managed BSSs enabled; retain the PMF/mwlwifi warning below | online, both managed BSSs enabled |

**The oldest open question in this file is closed.** The WRT3200ACM's wedge is
triggered by **PMF (`ieee80211w`) on the mwlwifi driver**: key installation
fails during an 802.11r fast-transition roam, and 85 seconds later the 5 GHz
firmware stops answering and takes every radio on the box with it. Proved by
running it both ways on **one boot** — 14h50m clean with clients and PMF off,
then the wedge back inside two minutes of a single forced roam with PMF on. The
shipped defect warning now carries that measurement instead of a wiki citation.
**Keep PMF off on Marvell hardware.**

**Current wired topology, re-established during the 2026-08-22 fresh-start
run.** Earlier dual-homed and alternate-port descriptions are historical and
superseded:

| | |
|---|---|
| wired test client | WRT `lan2` |
| WRT `lan3` | C6 LAN member `eth0.1`, on the shared management LAN |
| WRT `wan` | upstream network |
| C6 `wan` (`eth0.2`) | unused |

LLDP now verifies the same physical relation without turning dynamic FDB aging
into a permanent claim. The v40 startup and direct-URL check shows only
the measured C6-to-WRT `lan3` edge, with no reciprocal duplicate.

**Wireless currently configured:** one sanitized WPA2-only lab WLAN on both APs
and both available bands, with PMF and 802.11r disabled for WRT3200ACM
compatibility and 802.11k/v enabled. Exact SSIDs, BSSIDs and client identifiers
remain in ignored local evidence, not this public handoff. The final topology
pass retained one explicit `hostapd.get_clients` association-coverage warning;
it did not invent an empty client set.

**Credentials.** Both controller logins are sealed in `.run/oonfeewrt.db` under
the random data key wrapped by `.run/keyring.json`; adoption never returns the
password it generates. The database and keyring are therefore one restore pair,
not interchangeable files. The live schema-19 database retains schema 14's
sealed WLAN/mesh keys and secret-derived ownership verifiers and adds the
optional-capability rollback ledger. Nothing tracked in this repository holds
live device passwords, WLAN keys, SSH private keys or raw lab identifiers; §7
has how to check or reset a device password by asking the device rather than a
document.

Both routers now have distinct root passwords set during the isolated
fresh-start procedure. Empty-password logins were explicitly rejected before
adoption. Earlier statements that root had no password are historical and
superseded. The controller still detects and warns about stock passwordless-root
behavior, never changes `/etc/shadow`, and keeps administrator passwords/private
keys transient for adoption, cleanup and optional-package actions.

**One habit worth inheriting:** before any experiment that writes to a device's
network config, arm a restore on the device itself first (§6, "arm the undo
before the experiment"). It saved this work three times.

## 1. Historical short version — superseded

> This was the Phase-1/2 handoff summary. It is retained for provenance and is
> not the current completion boundary. Use §0 and §5br for the current live
> state; §5bl retains the schema-17, two-device Phase-4 boundary.

The design is no longer a design. It was validated against a real
**Linksys WRT3200ACM running OpenWrt 25.12.5**, which corrected several
assumptions, and then **Phases 0, 1 and most of 2 were built in Go and
TypeScript** against those findings.

**Phase 0 is complete, including both of ROADMAP's proofs.** Proof 1 (a broken
config reverts on its own and is reported honestly from a second session) and
Proof 2 (adopt, use, remove, and the config matches a pre-adoption snapshot
byte for byte — 369 UCI lines and 9 ACL files before, 374 and 10 while adopted,
369 and 9 after) are both asserted against real hardware.

**Phase 1 is complete.** Adopt a device from the UI — found by a network scan or
by address — poll it inside a measured budget, roll the samples into SQLite,
serve them through an authenticated API, push live updates over a WebSocket, and
render it in a browser: dashboard, devices with charts, a virtualized client
grid, logs paged and faceted in SQL. ~105 KB of UI gzipped against a 1.5 MB
budget.

**Roaming is now more than configuration.** As of 2026-08-16 the controller
distributes 802.11k neighbour lists across the fleet — reading each AP's own
neighbour element and telling every other AP on the same SSID about it. That is
the first feature here that hand configuration cannot reproduce at all, because
no AP can learn what is around it. §5t.

**Phase 2 is largely complete; the proof's behavior is met on two APs, while
its literal three-AP breadth remains open.** One SSID edited once lands on both
bands with an identical derived mobility domain, a hand-edited section
elsewhere on the devices is untouched, and the whole thing is previewed per
device before anything is written. Networks (VLAN, DHCP, firewall zone) render
too, within a limit that hardware imposed; DHCP enablement, pool and lease are
now configurable and validated end to end. §5g is still the single most
important thing in this file.

Twenty Go packages plus a UI. Everything that touches a device has been
verified against one.

## 2. The reference devices

| | |
|---|---|
| Models | Linksys WRT3200ACM (mvebu/cortexa9, class A) and TP-Link Archer C6 v2 (ath79/generic, class C), OpenWrt 25.12.5 |
| Reached at | sanitized management aliases over the isolated lab LAN |
| Root access | distinct root passwords set; TOFU SSH identities pinned separately |
| WAN | WRT gateway up on the upstream network; C6 WAN unused |
| Radios | both devices expose two enabled managed WPA2 BSSs |

**Current footprint on each:** `/usr/share/rpcd/acl.d/oonfeewrt.json`, one scoped
`rpcd` login, two controller-owned WLAN sections, and the separately authorized
official-feed packages `libcap`, `libevent2-7`, and `lldpd`. The WRT ledger binds
`lan1`–`lan4`; the C6 ledger binds `eth0.1`. Removing LLDP requires its reviewed
rollback before un-adoption. No controller-authored executable runs on either
router.

Running the hardware tests:

```bash
OONFEE_TEST_HOST=<router-address> OONFEE_TEST_USER=oonfeewrt OONFEE_TEST_PASS=... \
  go test -tags=integration -p 1 ./internal/... -run Integration -timeout 400s
```

`-p 1` is **required**: packages otherwise run in parallel against one device,
and one package's armed rollback makes another's login shared (see §4).

The suite now includes `internal/collector` (a real poll under the scoped
credential, which is where a missing ACL grant shows up) and `internal/daemon`
(the sealed credential opening a real session, and the collector writing
`last_seen` back to SQLite).

Also: `tools/probe.py` (hardware validation), `tools/mock_ubus.py` (the contract
fixture — it reproduces the measured semantics, including the awkward ones),
`deploy/acl/oonfeewrt.json` (the only optional device-side file; adoption may
also create one scoped rpcd login).

---

## 4. Measured device behaviour that the code depends on

These were discovered by measurement and several **contradicted the original
design**. Full detail in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md` §14 and §15; this is the short list
for someone picking the work up.

**The apply path**
- `uci.apply {rollback:true}` works and **reloads services** — an SSID change was
  observed changing on air and reverting on air.
- `uci.apply` returns **status 0 even when the applied config kills the service**
  (an invalid dnsmasq port applied cleanly while DNS died). Status is not health.
- Health must therefore run **before** confirm, while the timer is still armed:
  a failed change then costs nothing, because we simply decline to confirm.
- `uci.confirm` **and** `uci.rollback` are bound to the session that applied.
- `uci.apply` is one **all-or-nothing transaction** across every staged config,
  and is **globally serialised** — a second session's armed apply is refused with
  status 6, which means "already armed", *not* an authorization failure.
- **An armed rollback does not survive an rpcd restart.** The change stays
  applied and unconfirmable. This is why outcomes are three-valued.
- After a rollback, the applying session still reads the value it **failed** to
  set; a fresh session reads the reverted one.
- **While a rollback is armed, `session.login` returns the applying session's
  token to any caller.** So an independent session is unavailable inside the
  window, and destroying "the verification session" destroys the applier's —
  which silently reverts a healthy change. `FreshSession` marks these `Shared()`
  and `Destroy` refuses to act on them.

**ACLs and denials**
- `list read '*'` is **not** a superuser. It expands only over access-groups
  defined on disk.
- `uci` grants are **two-dimensional**: methods under `"ubus"` *and* config names
  under a sibling `"uci"` key. Both must match.
- `file.exec` matches the command **resolved to its absolute path**.
- File paths are **authorized as requested, then canonicalised and re-authorized**;
  `*` **crosses `/`**. Thus `/sys/class/net/*` cannot substitute for the
  `/sys/devices/*` target, and dnsmasq health needs read-only grants for both its
  `/var/etc/dnsmasq.conf.*` service path and `/tmp/etc/dnsmasq.conf.*` target.
- **ubus status 6** = session valid, target refused → permanent, never retry.
  **JSON-RPC −32002** = rpcd refused to proxy → ambiguous (dead session *or*
  ungranted method) → exactly one re-login disambiguates.
- An rpcd restart destroys every session. Adoption avoids one: rpcd re-reads
  both the ACL dir and the login config at session-creation time.

**Telemetry**
- `iwinfo` is ~92% of a focused poll (194 ms vs 15.8 ms without it).
  `hostapd.<iface>` is ~30× cheaper for per-AP status, but **not** a substitute
  for `assoclist`, which alone carries `tx.retries`, `connected_time`,
  `signal_avg`, `noise`, `thr`.
- `hostapd.rate` is **100×** `iwinfo.rate`. Never mix them.
- Three mwlwifi quirks, all *present but wrong*: `rx_time`/`tx_time` never
  advance (so interference and the airtime split are not computable); survey
  `noise` is **unsigned** (161 for −95); per-station `noise` swings **37 dB**
  between reads (so per-sample SNR flails).
- `network.wireless` is **entirely unreachable** through rpcd.
- uhttpd keep-alive is **20 s**; the ubus session idle timer is **300 s** and any
  call refreshes it.
- Zero flash writes under sustained polling. Software flow offload does **not**
  break per-client accounting.
- **The two poll tiers are worth their complexity**, measured through the real
  collector under the scoped credential, best of five, each one batched request:
  **baseline 8 ms for 7 calls, focused 116 ms for 11.** A 14× difference for
  four extra calls is the whole argument for fetching `iwinfo` only while
  somebody is looking.
- **`iwinfo.survey`'s `busy_time` and `active_time` are COUNTERS with different
  epochs.** Both advance correctly, but their absolute values are not
  comparable, so utilization is Δbusy/Δactive and never the ratio of absolutes.
  Measured: 5 GHz absolute 1354.7 % against delta 1.7 %; 2.4 GHz absolute 25.9 %
  against delta **73.3 %** — the dangerous one, because 25.9 % looks entirely
  reasonable and is wrong by 3×. hostapd's independent BSS-load reading settled
  it. This corrected a claim asserted as verified in three documents.
- **A WebSocket handshake is not protected by the CSRF token.** The same-origin
  policy does not apply to WebSockets: any page anywhere can open one to the
  controller and the browser attaches the session cookie, and the upgrade is a
  GET so no mutating-request check fires. `/api/v1/live` checks Origin itself.
- **The shipped defaults now meet the shipped budget, because the harness
  checked.** Measured through the real collector: **idle 1.00 polls/min (60
  requests/hour), observed 6.00 req/min, zero flash writes**, 0.49% device CPU
  across the run. The first run failed at 1.08 req/min idle and found two real
  defects — interface discovery was a separate unbatched call, and the focused
  default was 8 s against a stated ceiling of one request per 10 s.
- **Root over ubus is not root, so adoption cannot bootstrap over it.** As
  root: `uci.get rpcd`, `uci.set rpcd.*` and `file.write` into
  `/usr/share/rpcd/acl.d/` all return status 6, while `file.read /etc/rc.local`
  returns 0. rpcd's own ACLs bound `/ubus`, and stock OpenWrt grants write
  access to neither the rpcd config nor the ACL directory — deliberately. The
  footprint therefore arrives over **SSH, twice in a device's lifetime**
  (adoption and un-adoption); everything else stays ubus. That build has **no
  `base64`** and **no `sftp-server`**, so content is piped to `cat` over stdin.
- **A stock device with no root password accepts anything** — any password over
  ubus, and the SSH `none` method. Adoption probes for it and warns.
- **The capability probe must run on the CONTROLLER's session, after its ACL
  exists.** Probing first as the operator answers "what can root see", which is
  a different question and a different answer: on a genuinely fresh device it
  recorded survey, hostapd control and per-client accounting as *undetermined*
  on hardware that has all three.
- **The client inventory is cheap.** `luci-rpc.getHostHints` 5.1 ms,
  `getDHCPLeases` 2.9 ms; adding both took the baseline poll from 8 ms to 11 ms
  batched. `luci-rpc.getWirelessDevices` is **128.8 ms** — as expensive as an
  entire focused poll — so it belongs to adoption and must never enter a poll.
- **802.11k neighbour lists are runtime state, and `wifi reload` clears them
  SELECTIVELY.** Measured: after editing one wifi-iface section and reloading,
  the reconfigured BSS came back with an empty list while an untouched BSS on
  the same device kept its own intact. So neither "an apply clears everything"
  nor "an apply clears nothing" is a safe assumption, and the list must be read
  back rather than remembered. `rrm_nr_get_own` returns a **positional triple**
  `[bssid, ssid, nr_hex]`, and `rrm_nr_list` returns entries in hostapd's own
  storage order — neither insertion order nor sorted — so comparison has to be
  order-insensitive or the reconciler never converges.
- **The noise floor is a per-radio capability, and changing source does not
  rescue it.** The documented advice was "`iwinfo.survey` reports noise
  unsigned, so read it from `iwinfo.info`" — right about the encoding, silent
  about trust. Over 20 samples the 2.4 GHz radio swung **42 dB through
  `iwinfo.info` and 46 dB through `iwinfo.survey`**, while the 5 GHz radio on
  the same driver held within 7 dB. Channel busy time does not explain it.
  `Radio.NoiseStable` now gates it per radio, and the detector is asymmetric:
  a disagreement proves the value moves, agreement proves nothing.

## 5. What to do next

**Phase 4.1 source is the schema-19 `v0.1.0` release baseline.** It preserves
the hardware-verified topology/radio/log/client work and adds polished
presentation, controller operations, accounts, diagnostics and portable
backup/restore. Historical `v0.1.0-rc.1` remains the schema-17 upgrade baseline.

### v0.1.0 release inventory

1. **Visual foundation and text density.** **Landed:**
   the 64 px rail now uses coherent 24 px project-owned SVGs, expands to labels,
   and persists per controller/account. The authored `Notice` disclosure keeps
   actions visible; Dashboard count definitions and optional capabilities use
   it. Critical, destructive and install consent stays prominent.
2. **Accounts before new privileged APIs.** **Core slice landed
   2026-08-22:** schema 19 makes the existing admin an enabled `owner`; defines
   canonical `owner`/`admin`/`operator`/`viewer`; enforces ASCII-NOCASE username
   uniqueness, soft deletion, an atomic last-enabled-owner guard and
   transactional mutation audit. Role-bearing sessions, exhaustive server-side
   route/live authorization, My Account, owner account administration,
   five-minute password step-up and session listing/revocation are implemented.
   Revocation closes `/live` and cancels in-flight requests.
3. **Diagnostics.** **Source slice landed 2026-08-22; live screen smoke passed
   2026-08-23:** a private bounded rotating controller JSONL sink mirrors
   accepted structured records. Owner/admin can preview, generate, cancel and
   download a bounded, checksummed, redacted ZIP containing controller and
   stored device/topology/radio/source/event evidence. Stored mode makes zero
   router management/API/SSH calls and zero router changes. No live-router
   refresh mode exists.
4. **Dashboard and controller speed test.** **Source slice landed 2026-08-22;
   live Dashboard smoke passed 2026-08-23:** the server-selected six-hour WAN
   view and polished Dashboard preserve null gaps/freshness and never guess an
   interface-series key. The consent-bound controller-host Cloudflare job is
   single-stream, 15 MiB/30 seconds, one-active, cancellable, audited and
   restart-recovered; it makes no router management/API/SSH call or router
   change. Selecting Run is a fresh acknowledgement bound to the exact current
   descriptor plan ID; a changed plan is rejected before a job is created. The
   three newest terminal attempts are retained separately from active work.
   Loaded latency/jitter remain
   unavailable. Public-provider execution remains explicit and separate from
   deterministic release tests. A gateway-run test stays deferred to a separately
   installed official-feed capability with an exact plan and rollback.
5. **Encrypted backup/restore.** **Schema-19 source slice landed and its live
   owner screen passed smoke on 2026-08-23:** owner-only native `.oowrtbak`
   export packages a consistent live-WAL database/key pair under a separate
   export passphrase. Bounded raw upload and disposable preview authenticate,
   migrate and recovery-validate the fixed artifact. Confirmation is plan-bound,
   recently reauthenticated, verifies the destination runtime passphrase, and
   requires exact destructive text plus four acknowledgements. A controlled
   restart retains an encrypted safety artifact, revokes sessions, and persists
   router-write suppression until exact-text owner resume. Restored desired
   state is never auto-Applied; read-only monitoring may resume while
   suppressed. Explicit resume immediately enables automatic 802.11k neighbour
   maintenance and may write hostapd RRM neighbour state without starting a
   desired-configuration Apply. The final release matrix owns isolated
   end-to-end restore and clean-container recovery proof.
6. **Stable release.** The tag pipeline builds byte-reproducible
   multi-architecture archives and pinned multi-platform images, runs
   vulnerability gates, signs the immutable image digest, and publishes stable
   aliases. Its isolated candidate checks cover accounts,
   deterministic-local speed test, diagnostics, backup/restore, RC upgrade and
   rollback without contacting a router; anonymous verification follows
   publication.

The broader mobile overhaul, DPI/application identity, exact UniFi cloning,
automatic speed tests and hidden router installs are outside Phase 4.1. Older
numbered “next” items are completed or superseded history in §§5t–5bl; they are
not the current queue.

### If you are picking this up cold

**Baseline recorded at the end of the earlier 2026-08-18 session.** The working
tree was clean and pushed to `origin/main`; all Go packages and 107 UI tests
were green, with `gofmt` and `tools/secret-scan.sh` clean. Use `git status` for
the current checkout rather than treating this historical line as live state.

**Historical 2026-08-18 baseline, superseded by §5bl.** WRT3200ACM (class A) was
Gateway + AP + Switch; Archer C6 v2 (class C) was AP + Switch. The schema-14
controller had a durable receipt for each Apply. The WRT was
VLAN-aware and retains the intended VLAN2/DHCP/firewall network from §5be; the
legacy-swconfig C6 truthfully omits that VLAN while retaining the base site WLAN.
§5bg deleted the temporary VLAN2 WLAN, restored DHCP `100`/`150`/`12h`, reset
`lan2` to its inherited WAN-only policy and rotated the base WLAN key. Both
devices were cleanly un-adopted, inspected and re-adopted in §5bc; if the fleet
looks empty again, read §5ax's host-routing failure before assuming a device
defect.

**Schema 19 is the current live store.** §5bf remains the historical schema-14
migration/backup proof and §5bg its cleanup endpoint. §5bh records the later
source-only checkpoint, §5bi the initial signed-in read-only screen pass, §5bj
the superseded no-change checkpoint, §5bk the Phase-4 boundary, and §5bl the
fresh-start/schema-17 boundary; §5br records the controlled schema-19 upgrade
and current recovery/UI-smoke evidence. Default adoption installed only the separately
acknowledged ACL/login payload and no package. The optional/default-off LLDP
workflow was later authorized, rolled back with hardened verification, and
reinstalled/configured on both routers.

**One host-level trap, because it cost an entire evening.** Two USB ethernet
adapters on the same `192.0.2.0/24` make macOS mark the subnet routes
`RTF_REJECT`. `curl`, `ping` and Python keep working (blocking connects) while
every Go dial fails instantly with `no route to host` — so the shell says the
fleet is fine and the controller cannot see it. Check `netstat -rn -f inet |
grep 192.0.2` for a `!` flag before believing discovery. §5bd closes the
running-daemon recovery defect: the collector discards its keep-alive transport
after the first hard poll failure, so the next poll redials on the repaired
route without creating a login storm. A route that is still rejected by the
host must still be fixed on the host.

The daemon runs from a scratch build:

```bash
go build -o /tmp/oonfeewrtd ./cmd/oonfeewrtd
/tmp/oonfeewrtd -data-dir "$PWD/.run" -listen 127.0.0.1:8080 \
  -passphrase-file ~/.oonfeewrt/passphrase
```

Sessions are in memory by design, so **every restart signs the operator out** —
batch UI changes and restart once, or you will ask them to sign in repeatedly.
Rebuild the UI (`npm --prefix ui run build`) before restarting or the browser
keeps serving the old bundle.

**The one long-running question is closed.** The WRT3200ACM's wedge is PMF
(§5an): key installation fails during an 802.11r roam and the 5 GHz firmware
stops answering 85 seconds later, taking every radio with it. Keep
`ieee80211w=0` on Marvell. Do **not** re-run the PMF experiments — §5an explains
why the remaining untested combination is not worth a radio.

Read **§0** first (the reference hardware lies, and why), then **§6** (the
mistakes already made and the rules that came out of them). Those two explain
most of the decisions in the code.

**The current completion boundary is §5br; §5bl plus the final fresh-start log
rows retain the Phase-4 hardware/release-candidate boundary.**
Everything below this block is standing guidance. §5be closes the durable-operation,
signed-in browser, VLAN/DHCP/firewall LIST, directional-WAN and runtime
custom-DHCP proofs; §5bf closes live schema-14 promotion and the rebuilt-browser
reconciliation; §5bg closes that lab cleanup; §5bi records schema-16 promotion
and the initial signed-in, read-only Phase-4 pass; §5bj is its superseded
no-change checkpoint; §5bk records the accepted scoped capability refresh and
the Phase-4 proof boundary; §5bl and FS-104–FS-118 record the schema-17
rollback/reinstall, topology convergence and direct-route proof, while
FS-119–FS-120 record publication, clean installation, and post-release
permission hardening.

1. **Keep Phase 3's remaining claim narrow.** The latest run put two physical
   iPhones on the same isolated WRT BSS at once and proved distinct DHCP,
   fixed-IP WAN reachability, DNS plus WAN reachability and denial to a
   known-live LAN HTTP listener from both clients. Both also reported reciprocal
   raw Safari peer-IP failures, but neither peer ran a known-live listener and
   no positive control proved that either address would answer that probe.
   Therefore two-client DHCP/DNS/WAN and no-LAN behavior is closed, while the
   literal bidirectional peer data-plane isolation claim remains open. §5bk
   records the runtime evidence and cleanup.

2. **Phase 4's hardware boundary is §5bl; the current Phase-4.1 live runtime is
   §5br at schema 19.** ACL refresh and official-feed LLDP remain distinct,
   optional/default-off workflows. Leaving
   either box unchecked or cancelling sends no mutation request. The ACL path
   installs no package; LLDP installation/configuration names and records its
   exact package/service/UCI changes and blocks un-adoption until verified
   rollback. No RF scan ran merely to prove access.

Then, in order of value:

- **The package-by-package review sweep is FINISHED** (§5ag, §5aq, §5ar, §5as,
  §5at, §5au — nine packages, fifteen defects). Do not restart it from the top;
  a second pass over the same code is worth much less than the two things below.

  **What it found, in one sentence, because it will happen again:** every defect
  sat in the seam between what was ASKED and what came BACK, and the three worst
  were a question nobody answered being spent as though it were an answer — a
  refused radio list that deleted every interface on the device, a broken
  invariant that meant un-adopt could never remove our own config, and a missing
  record entry that told the operator their hardware lacks a feature.

  **So the standing rule, for any code written from here:** find the values that
  have a "we do not know" state and check every consumer of them — especially
  the ones that DELETE, and the ones that produce a sentence an operator will
  act on. And when a fix changes an invariant, grep for who relied on it; §5at's
  worst finding was caused by §5as, one package away.

- **Run `tools/dryrun` after ANY change to render, reconcile or capability.**

  ```bash
  OONFEE_PASSPHRASE_FILE="$HOME/.oonfeewrt/passphrase" \
    go run ./tools/dryrun "$PWD/.run/oonfeewrt.db"
  ```

  It opens SQLite with both `mode=ro` and `query_only`, then renders and plans
  the live site model against the real devices without mutating controller or
  router state. The mode-0600 passphrase file and adjacent matching
  `keyring.json` are mandatory; the current read-only tools require a fully
  current, fully scrubbed schema-17 store and do not migrate it. §5av added it, and it
  immediately found the reference Archer C6 being
  told it had not reported a wired layout it had reported perfectly well — with
  the whole suite green, because no mock in this repo knows what a swconfig
  board looks like. Both devices should report **0 ops, 0 prunes** on an
  unchanged model; anything else is the change you just made.

- **The apply path is proven on hardware as of §5aw** — both devices, health
  passed, confirm landed, verified from a fresh session, and a re-plan reports
  0 ops. `tools/applyone <db> <host>` does one device at a time; run
  `tools/optdiff` first, which prints the option-level diff before anything is
  staged. Every controller-database tool requires `OONFEE_PASSPHRASE_FILE` and
  the matching keyring next to the database. `applyone` opens writable and can
  migrate an older store, so migrate separately after a paired backup rather
  than discovering a schema change during an apply. The live store has already
  completed that controlled promotion (§5bf).

  **Now applied on hardware:** §5be records the WRT's one-time operator-owned
  VLAN-awareness conversion followed by the controller-owned bridge-VLAN,
  static interface, DHCP, firewall-zone LIST and forwarding/rule stack. The C6
  remained a truthful no-op because legacy swconfig is observe-only.

- **Check what a setting does when turned OFF, not just on.** §5aw found four
  settings that could be turned on and not off, one of them the exact remedy
  for the project's worst known hardware defect. `tools/stalecheck` renders the
  live model with a flag cleared and reports what the plan would leave behind.
- **Look at a screen in a browser.** **Forty-seven** defects had been found this
  way before §5ax, and not one was reachable by any test in the repo. §5ax added
  more, including "radio radio0 is gone" printed about a radio that was carrying
  the SSID — found by finally opening the apply preview that §5av's own guidance
  had recommended and nobody had opened. Everything has been looked at once now,
  so the yield is in what CHANGES — and in the screen
  ABOVE whatever was just changed, which is where the last two came from
  (§5ai): the daemon's un-adopt path grew a new way to fail, and reading the
  panel over it found that the panel had no way to recover from ANY of them.
- **Review whatever was written last, not just the code.** Three review rounds
  ran on 2026-08-16/17. The second found more than the first *because* it
  reviewed the first's fixes, including one that committed the exact error it
  was fixing. The third found four highs in code nobody had reviewed at all.
- **Mutation-test every new test.** Revert the fix; if the test still passes it
  asserts nothing. Six were caught that way in two days, none by reading.

**What the operator has already done:** the Archer C6's WPA passphrase was
rotated on 2026-08-17, closing the leak from `02e99d0`. That historical rotation
did not close the later disclosure recorded in §5bf; §5bg records the subsequent
managed-WLAN rotation and encrypted post-rotation recovery proof. The WRT3200ACM was power-cycled to recover
from the deliberate PMF wedge. Both
devices were re-adopted on 2026-08-18 after the routing incident in §5ax, are
named after their models, sit in the `all-aps` group, and carry `example-managed-wlan`.
The second USB ethernet adapter that broke routing has been unplugged.

**One thing still needs the operator, not the next session:**
- **A third router** unblocks mesh `peered`, the wireless uplink, three-AP
  fan-out and the first class-B budget measurement (class C is now covered by
  the C6). Any cheap MT7621 or ath79 box can cover several of those. The
  network/DHCP proof separately needs a disposable Gateway with an already
  VLAN-aware bridge; the current WRT must not be converted by the controller.

### Where I would start, if picking this up cold

If you are a new harness with no context: read the three-item queue above, then
§0, then §6. Item 1 needs a disposable VLAN-aware gateway; item 2 is the first
one that can be investigated without touching a router.

Not with a feature. The most valuable half-hour is **running the on-air check
(§5y) and then reading §0**, in that order. The first tells you whether the
fleet is actually doing what the controller believes; the second tells you why
that question needed asking. Everything else in this file is downstream of the
day those two things came apart.

**Landed 2026-08-16 alongside the neighbour work**, all from things the session
tripped over rather than planned: a factory reset is now diagnosed instead of
reported as a permission error (§5u); adoption refuses a second device at one
address; the setup helpers adopt instead of assuming a login exists; and an
unmeasured hardware class names its board target instead of rendering a bare
`?` (§5m item 3).

### Built but NOT TESTED, and what each one waits on

Nothing here is broken. Each is complete in code and tested from unit level up,
and each has a specific claim nobody has been able to check. Listed together so
a reader can see the shape of what the lab cannot reach — **the answer to almost
all of it is one more router**, and as of 2026-08-16 there is not one.

| what | untested claim | what would settle it |
|---|---|---|
| **Mesh `peered`** (§5w) | that two nodes find each other and the backhaul carries | any second mesh-capable device |
| **Wireless uplink** (§5x) | that a station associates and bridges | a device whose radio runs station mode — measured, neither of these two does |
| **Three-AP fan-out** | ROADMAP Phase 2's stated proof | any third AP |
| **Class B / C budget** | DEVICE-BUDGET's CPU and RAM rows | specifically an **MT7621** (class C) or **MT7981/filogic** (class B) |

The last row is narrower than the others and worth not conflating with them: an
ath79 or ipq40xx box closes the first three and leaves the fourth exactly where
it is, because `classify()` would call it `?` and no measured number would
attach to a class. **Class C sets the budget**, so that row is the one where the
shipped defaults are least justified — every figure in DEVICE-BUDGET comes from
the comfortable class.

Two things worth saying about this list. None of it blocks further development:
the pipeline is not per-device, so a third AP needs hardware rather than code.
And none of it should be quietly closed by reasoning — §5q, §5w and §5x are each
a case where every available signal said a thing would work and the device
disagreed.

### Blocked on something other than hardware

- **`usteer` / `dawn` configuration and state readout.** Neither is installed on
  the reference devices; both are in the official feeds. This sits behind the
  package-installation flow ARCHITECTURE §6 step 3 describes and nothing has
  built. Writing config for an absent package would be untestable, so it was not
  written.
- ~~**The WRT3200ACM under a client.**~~ **It has now had one, both ways** — §5am and §5an. The
  entry here previously said the device "has carried zero clients the entire
  time"; that was read off a live `get_clients` showing an empty list and was
  **wrong about the run as a whole**. Station telemetry and the device's own log
  both show a client associated to **phy0** — the 5 GHz radio whose firmware is
  the one that hangs — from 21 minutes after boot for 2h42m. What remains is
  breadth: one client, one run, and two variables changed at once.

### Before starting anything, read these

They are the parts of this file that will save the most time, in order:

- **§5g — the limit networks ran into.** A confirmed, "healthy" change that
  severed the network, and why the controller now refuses to enable VLAN
  filtering at all. If you touch `internal/render/network.go`, read this first.
- **§6 — working practices.** Every entry is there because it caught a real bug,
  usually one already written and believed.
- **§4 — measured device behaviour.** When code and docs disagree, the
  measurement wins; when neither matches the device, re-measure before changing
  either.

### How each piece landed

Chronological, 2026-08-14. Each is a section below with the findings, which are
the useful part — the code is in git either way.

| | |
|---|---|
| §5a | Discovery — the specified probe would have minted a root session on every passwordless device |
| §5b | The table system — six defects that 13,000 rows exposed, including a header that had never been sticky |
| §5c | Client scoping — it did not need the site model, only the device's |
| §5d | Management Overhead — attributable CPU cannot be sampled live, and latency is not load |
| §5e | Phase 2's first contact with hardware — three defects a mock could not reach |
| §5f | Per-device overrides — and the four things they deliberately cannot touch |
| §5g | Networks — **read this one** |
| §5h | The fleet client total — two screens answering one question two ways |
| §5i | Client paging — and the one rail that is not a column |
| §5j | Re-probing — and the difference between losing a feature and losing sight of it |
| §5k | What diffing two probes found in the probe itself |
| §5l | Column reorder, and getting UI logic under a check without a test runner |
| §5m | **Hardware breadth** — the stated direction, what it needs, and what assumed otherwise |
| §5n | 802.11s mesh — modelled as an interface mode, not a role |
| §5o | The bug mesh support created in the collector, found by looking for it |
| §5q | **Applying a mesh to real hardware** — and what every other source got wrong |
| §5r | **Two devices at last** — fast roaming verified across different SoCs |
| §5s | The roam demo — what it proved, what it did not, and the txpower trap |
| §5t | **Neighbour reports** — the first thing built that hand configuration cannot do |
| §5u | What a factory reset looks like from the controller, and why it used to look like nothing |
| §5v | **The browser pass** — four defects in one sitting, and why none was reachable by a test |
| §5w | **Mesh backhaul health** — a closed state vocabulary, and the four bugs only hardware could show |
| §5x | **The wireless uplink** — built end to end, and unprovable on this hardware for a sharper reason than mesh |
| §5y | **Asking the air** — the one check that does not trust the management plane, and the adoption bug it exposed |

### 5a. What discovery corrected

Both found by checking the spec against the device instead of implementing it,
and both are recorded in IMPLEMENTATION §14 and fixed in ARCHITECTURE §6.

- **The specified probe was unsafe.** ARCHITECTURE §6 said to fingerprint a
  device by a `session.login` that fails, "without logging in". On a device with
  no root password that login **succeeds** — status 0, a session token, an ACL
  set with `uci` write and `file` exec, for the password
  `definitely-not-the-password-9f3a`. The specified sweep would have minted a
  root session on every passwordless host in the subnet, on every scan. The
  probe used instead is `list` on the null session: no credential, no session,
  no failed-login record, and a much stronger fingerprint because it returns the
  whole object graph. A test asserts the probe makes exactly one request and
  that it is a `list`.
- **Nothing identifying is readable pre-auth.** §6 expected a pending device to
  show model, MAC and firmware "from `system.board` / `system.info` pre-auth
  where possible". Never possible: stock rpcd answers `system.board` on the null
  session with `-32002 Access denied`. The object list does carry the device's
  *shape* — radios with a BSS up (count PHYs, not BSSes), a wan interface, a
  DHCP server — so the UI shows that and says the model is unknown until you
  sign in.

mDNS was deliberately **not** built. ARCHITECTURE already said not to depend on
it because stock OpenWrt advertises nothing useful, and the subnet sweep finds
everything it would without needing anything installed on the device.

Measured: 508 addresses across two /24s in 4.8 s at 128 concurrent probes.
Sweep time is `(addresses / workers) x DialTimeout` and essentially nothing
else — a live host answers in under 5 ms, a dead one costs the full timeout.
The scan refuses anything wider than a /22, skips tunnel interfaces and IPv6,
is on demand only with no background timer, and **reports everything it
declined to look at** — a controller that silently skips the operator's subnet
reports "no devices found", which reads as a fact about their network rather
than about itself. Its one request against an already-managed device is
attributed to that device's Management Overhead readout
(`Collector.NoteExternalRequest`), because "negligible, therefore uncounted" is
how a readout stops being trustworthy.

**Then Phase 2**, which is where this becomes a controller rather than a nicer
LuCI: the site model → render → apply pipeline is already built and tested
(`internal/model`, `internal/render`, `internal/reconcile`), so Phase 2 is
largely the *screens* for it plus the pending-changes batching. Read
ROADMAP.md Phase 2 and IMPLEMENTATION §5–6 before starting.

**Setup is documented in the README** (`## Getting it running`), and every claim
in it was verified by following it: the build, the passphrase-file path, the
mode-600 refusal and the `OONFEE_PASSPHRASE` refusal. It states the three places
where low friction and security actually pull against each other and which way
each was decided — no default credentials, the passphrase never in the
environment, and a device with no root password warned about rather than
refused. If any of those decisions change, that table is the thing to update.

### 5b. What the table system corrected

Every one of these was found by running the grid against 13,106 seeded events —
the row count UI-SPEC quotes from the UniFi screenshots. None of them is
reachable at the 13 rows the screens had before.

- **The filter counts were the lie the spec warns about.** `Logs.tsx` carried a
  comment reading "Filter counts come from the whole result set, never from the
  visible page — a count computed from what happens to be loaded is a lie". It
  counted the array it was handed, which was the newest 300 of 13,106 rows. The
  comment asserted precisely the property it did not have. Counts now come from
  SQL `GROUP BY` over the whole table, each facet computed with the *other*
  filters applied but not its own — so "info 8,819" stays clickable while
  `severity=error` is selected, and the category rail re-scopes to the 2,116
  errors and sums to exactly that.
- **The sticky header was never sticky.** `position: sticky` resolves against
  the nearest scrolling ancestor, and `Card` sets `overflow: hidden` for its
  rounded corners — which made Card that ancestor. The header was pinned to the
  top of a box that does not scroll, so it slid away with the rows. Invisible
  for as long as no grid had enough rows to scroll. The grid now owns its
  scroll container.
- **`height: 33` on a table cell is a minimum, not a height.** Rows measured
  33.84px. Virtualization computes row N's position as `N x height`, so that
  0.84px compounded to 840px by row 1000 — a full screen of drift. Fixed by
  pinning the line box *and* measuring a real row, because a font that renders
  differently would silently reintroduce it. Verified after the fix: at
  scrollTop 16530 of 33060 the window shows row 500 of 1000 exactly, and the
  last row at the bottom is exactly the last row.
- **A windowed grid breaks find-in-page, so it says so.** ⌘F only searches
  rendered rows. The grid prints "1,000 rows, drawn as you scroll — ⌘F searches
  only what is on screen" whenever it is windowed, because a search that comes
  up empty is otherwise indistinguishable from the value being absent.
  Virtualization only engages above 150 rows for the same reason: below that the
  DOM cost is irrelevant and full-text search is worth more.
- **A selected filter with no matches vanished from the rail.** The client
  list defaults to `online`, none of its 14 clients were online, so the option
  dropped out of the count query — leaving an empty grid, "0 of 14", and
  nothing highlighted to explain why. The rail now always renders the selected
  option, at zero if that is the truth.
- **`Force` on un-adopt was dead code.** It is documented as removing a device
  "even if the device could not be reached at all — for hardware that is gone
  for good", and the check sat *after* the early return for
  `ErrOperatorRequired`. An unreachable device always takes that path, so the
  flag could never fire in the only case it exists for; the caller got a 409
  asking for the credential of a router that no longer exists. Found by trying
  it on a device whose credential had gone stale. Fixed, tested, and confirmed
  against real hardware — and a forced removal now logs the residue at WARN,
  because deleting the inventory row deletes the only record of what is still
  on that device.

### 5c. Client scoping needed the device's model, not ours

This item was in the backlog with a stated reason: "telling LAN from WAN needs
the site model to know what a LAN is, so it is really a Phase 3 dependency".
That was wrong, and wrong in a way worth writing down — the site model is *our*
description of a network, and the question does not need ours. It needs the
device's, which netifd already publishes and which one call returns.

`network.interface dump` gives every logical interface, its IPv4 subnets, and
its routes. A host is a client of this network when its address falls in a
subnet of an interface that is *not* carrying the default route, and a
neighbour on the uplink when it falls in one that is. Upstream is decided by
the routing table rather than by an interface being named `wan`, because the
name is a convention and a device bridged onto an existing network can have the
default route on the interface called `lan` — tested both ways round.

What it found on the reference device, which is why the item mattered: of 16
known hosts, **7 were upstream neighbours** on the UniFi network behind the WAN
port and only **3 were actual clients** (a laptop, a phone, a watch). Four have
no observed IPv4 at all and are therefore `unknown` — not `local`, because a
host that has not been shown to be on this network must not be counted as one.
The grid went from listing 14 things to listing 3, with the other 11 one click
away in the rail and labelled.

Cost: the call joins the existing batch on the same 15-minute cadence as the
radio list and the board identity, so it adds no requests. Budget harness after
the change: **1.00 polls/min idle, 6.00 req/min observed, zero flash writes** —
identical, with 118 more bytes per poll. The timestamp is stamped where the
call is *built*, not where its answer is decoded, so a device whose ACL refuses
`network.interface` does not re-ask on every poll forever.

Two rules the storage had to respect. A determination is never overwritten by a
non-determination — the subnets are re-read every fifteen minutes and carried
forward in between, so a poll that cannot classify would otherwise flicker
clients out of the default view for reasons no operator could see. And a row
written before the column existed reads as `unknown`, never `local`: defaulting
it would assert something never measured.

### 5d. What the CPU measurement found

DEVICE-BUDGET §7 asked for "CPU percent attributable to oonfeeWRT" and the
backlog note said it "needs a control measurement to be honest". It did, and
the measurement's first result was that **a live sample can never work**: a
baseline poll costs ~5 ms of device CPU once a minute — 0.009% of one core —
against a device whose own idle CPU is 0.38–0.43%. The quantity is about fifty
times below the floor it would be measured against and far below that floor's
minute-to-minute jitter. Sampling it live would report noise with a decimal
point on it.

So it is derived from a control experiment (CPU over a window with nothing
polling vs a window with a known number of polls), and the UI says so — the
tooltip carries the entire basis rather than a reassuring word.

| | class A reference device |
|---|---|
| control, nothing polling | 0.38–0.43% busy |
| baseline poll, 8 invocations | 5.33 ms of device CPU |
| focused poll, 12 invocations | 6.65 ms of device CPU |
| at the shipped baseline (1/60 s) | 0.0089% of one core |
| at the shipped focused (6/60 s) | 0.067% of one core |

Linearity was checked rather than assumed: 4.56 ms/poll at 6,049 polls/min and
4.38 ms/poll at 372 polls/min, within 4%.

**The finding worth carrying forward:** DEVICE-BUDGET §4 measures iwinfo as
~92% of a focused poll, but a focused poll costs only **1.25×** a baseline one
in CPU. That 92% is latency — `iwinfo.survey` and `iwinfo.assoclist` block on
the wireless driver rather than burning cycles. Wall time and CPU load are
different quantities and the docs had been using the first to reason about the
second.

The figure is reported only for classes it was measured on. Class C gets no
number and a sentence saying why, for the same reason everything else here is
three-state.

The interval control only ever loosens, and the clamp lives in the collector
rather than in request validation — the budget is a promise, the harness
measures the default, and a knob that could raise the rate would put a device
outside the budget where no test would look. Verified on hardware: an override
of 5 s stores as 5 and polls at 60.

### 5e. Phase 2's first contact with hardware

The render → apply pipeline was built and unit-tested in Phase 0 and recorded
here as "mock-verified only". Wiring it to a real device found three defects in
the first hour, all of them invisible to a mock, and then met the proof.

- **`uci.get` does not return only strings.** `ReadExisting` decoded into
  `map[string]map[string]string`. Every UCI *option* is a string, but the
  section metadata is not — `.anonymous` is a bool and `.index` a number — so
  the decoder failed the entire read and **every device reported as
  unplannable**. This is the exact shape of the mock-green problem §6 already
  names: the mock returned strings throughout.
- **A new BSS is not up the instant `uci.apply` returns.** The health check read
  hostapd once, immediately, found the SSID absent, and let the device revert.
  Correct by its own logic, wrong in fact — measured, a BSS appears about a
  second after the reload. It now polls for up to 20 s inside the 90 s window,
  and names what the radios *are* carrying when it fails. Worth saying plainly:
  the revert was flawless. `/etc/config/wireless` came back byte-identical, zero
  of our sections, the operator's own section untouched. The safety mechanism
  did exactly its job on a false alarm, which is the failure mode you want.
- **`Doc.Plan` never compared before writing.** It emitted a set for every
  existing section, so a converged device reported "2 changes pending" forever
  and `Empty()` could never be true — a no-op apply would still stage, apply and
  confirm, arming a rollback for nothing. Fixed to skip sections whose managed
  values already match, comparing only the keys we write.

**The proof, on hardware.** One WLAN on two bands, 802.11r/k/v:

| | |
|---|---|
| sections from one WLAN | 2 — one per radio |
| mobility domain on each | `e8ee`, identical, derived not coordinated |
| passphrase changed **once**, landed on | both bands, no per-device work |
| mobility domain after that change | `e8ee`, unchanged |
| hand-edited foreign section | untouched through apply, re-apply and prune |
| prune after deleting the WLAN | our sections gone, the human's kept |
| preview once converged | 0 changes |

"Three APs" is unmet for want of hardware, and that is the only part that is.
Nothing in the pipeline is per-device — render is driven by group membership and
the mobility domain is derived rather than agreed — so a second AP needs no new
mechanism, only a second AP.

### 5f. What per-device overrides deliberately cannot do

The `device_overrides` table had been in the schema since the beginning with
nothing reading it. It now works, and the design decision worth defending is the
short list of what may be overridden:

| overridable | not overridable |
|---|---|
| whether a WLAN is published on this AP | SSID |
| whether it beacons its name here | passphrase |
| whether clients here are isolated | security mode, PMF |
| how many clients may associate here | 802.11r/k/v and the mobility domain |

The right-hand column is the product. A controller exists to keep exactly those
settings identical across every AP, because they are miserable to maintain by
hand and they fail *confusingly* when they drift — a client roaming between two
APs that disagree about the key does not fail cleanly, it fails intermittently,
and the resulting support question is "why does WiFi drop when I walk down the
hall".

So they are absent from the vocabulary rather than present with a warning. An
escape hatch that can break the one guarantee the system offers is not an escape
hatch; it is a slow leak. The API refuses an unknown key by name and says why.

The left-hand column all vary legitimately per AP — a guest network in the lobby
and not the server room is a real requirement — and none of them can
desynchronise a client's view of a network it is already associated with.

Two implementation points that needed care. Overrides are applied to a **copy**
of the WLAN, or the second device rendered inherits the first device's
deviations. And malformed values fail closed: anything but `1`/`true` reads as
false, so a corrupt row cannot quietly switch something on.

Verified on hardware: a forbidden key refused with its reason; `disabled` on one
device rendered nothing there and reported both an omission and a deviation;
`hidden` applied to both radios while `encryption`, the key and the mobility
domain stayed identical across them.

Every deviation is listed in three places — the settings screen, the per-device
preview row, and a site-level summary — because the risk of overrides is never
any single one. It is a fleet that drifts apart device by device until nobody
can say what is actually deployed.

### 5g. The limit that networks ran into

IMPLEMENTATION §5's worked example 2 shows a network rendering as a
bridge-VLAN, an interface, a DHCP server and a firewall zone. All of it is now
built. The worked example is also **incomplete in a way that takes the LAN
down**, and it took three outages of the reference device to pin down why.

**Adding any `bridge-vlan` switches the bridge to VLAN filtering**, and a stock
`br-lan` is not ready for that. Measured:

| | |
|---|---|
| `vlan_filtering` | 0 → 1 |
| `br-lan` | UP, still holding `192.0.2.1/24` |
| `ip neigh show dev br-lan` | **empty — not one neighbour** |
| the apply engine's verdict | `applied — health passed and confirm landed` |
| actual reachability | gone, until a pre-armed restore fired |

Read that table twice. The health check passed because it asks whether the
`lan` interface is up — and it was. The confirm landed. **A confirmed,
"healthy", network-severing change, with no error anywhere in the chain.**

Connectivity survives only if the operator's own `lan` interface moves from
`br-lan` to `br-lan.1`. Verified: with that one edit, filtering on, `br-lan.1`
held the address and this machine stayed `REACHABLE` in the device's neighbour
table. But that section is the operator's, and rewriting the interface we reach
a device through — on a device we might then be unable to reach — is exactly
what ARCHITECTURE §0 forbids.

So the controller **refuses**, and names the one-time change. Once an operator
has made it, VLANs are managed normally: verified end to end, then pruned,
leaving `/etc/config/{network,firewall,dhcp}` byte-identical to their pre-test
md5s.

Two other things fell out of the same sequence.

**A UCI list is not a string with spaces in it.** `uci.set` accepts
`option ports 'lan1:u* lan2:u*'` where UCI wants `list ports`, stores it, and
netifd ignores it — no error at any layer. `Section` and `Op` now carry `Lists`
separately.

**Two guards for one concern is defence in depth; two definitions of it is a
bug.** The apply engine already had a management-path gate covering `network`;
the daemon grew its own covering `network` and `firewall`. They would have
drifted — an operator warned about a change the engine then allowed, or worse
the reverse. There is now one exported definition, `applyengine.TouchesManagementPath`,
and it covers both configs: a zone whose input policy is REJECT blocks the
controller as effectively as a broken interface, and the zone we render for a
new network defaults to exactly that.

**Open items that need hardware I do not have:**
- Class B/C devices. **Class C (MT7621) sets the budget** and every number so
  far comes from the comfortable class — TLS alone doubled poll CPU there. The
  budget harness runs anywhere; it has only ever run against class A, so the
  CPU and RAM rows of DEVICE-BUDGET §2 remain unverified where they bind.
- Hardware flow offload (mvebu has none), so the README's accounting tradeoff
  remains scoped to hardware offload and untested.
- A second device, for genuine fleet behaviour. The stagger, the per-device
  backoff and "ten devices at 60 s is one request every 6 s" are unit-tested and
  none of them has met a second real router.
- **A 32-bit interface counter.** The wrap-recovery path is unit-tested but has
  never seen a real wrap: determining the reference device's counter width would
  need 3 GB pushed through it. The code is written to be correct either way.

**Known gaps worth closing cheaply:**
- ~~`internal/model` has no tests of its own.~~ Closed 2026-08-14: the override
  vocabulary has its own suite (`override_test.go`), and the rest is exercised
  through `render` and `store`'s site-model round-trips.
- ~~`reconcile` is mock-verified only.~~ Closed 2026-08-14: it now runs against
  the real device through the Phase 2 apply flow, which is how the `uci.get`
  decode bug was found (§5e).
- **The UI's automated tests cannot see layout, and a person is still the only
  thing that catches a dead affordance.** Driving it in a browser has now caught
  **nineteen** defects no unit test would have
  — three from the discovery screen and six more from the table system (§5b),
  including a sticky header that had never once been sticky and a
  virtualization drift of 840px. That is a manual step someone has to remember,
  and it is now the single highest-value gap in the project's testing.
- Nothing re-probes capabilities after adoption. A firmware upgrade is detected
  and logged as a warning, and the stale registry is left in place. This one has
  grown teeth now that the renderer gates network rendering on the probed port
  map — it is item 2 in the do-next list above.

### 5h. One question, two screens, two answers

The client grid was scoped in §5c and the dashboard was not, so the same network
was described as **14 devices** on one screen and **3** on the other, both
captioned as this network's. That is worse than either number being wrong on its
own: whichever a person reads first is the one they stop trusting.

The fix worth noting is not the scoping — that was already done and measured —
it is that the two counts came from two different mechanisms. The dashboard
loaded up to 5000 client rows to call `len()` on them; the grid tallied whatever
page the browser had received. Both are correct only while the page is the whole
table, and neither survives the paging that is now item 1. They are one query
now, `store.ClientCounts`, counted in SQL and shared by both callers.

Two things fell out of doing it that way rather than patching the number:

- **The headline says what it excludes.** "3" with "7 upstream, 4 unplaced"
  under it. Without that line the count is simply smaller than the previous
  build's, and nothing distinguishes a correct rescoping from lost devices.
- **Every scope is always present in the result, zero-filled.** "0 local, 7
  upstream" renders as a rail a person can click; a missing key renders as no
  rail at all, which reads as "this build does not do scoping".

Verified on hardware through the daemon integration test, which seeds the
existing credential rather than adopting — so the check costs zero device
writes. Real device, real client mix: `3 on this network (3 active), 7 upstream,
4 unplaced` against a grid of `14 row(s), scopes map[local:3 unknown:4
upstream:7]`. The test now asserts the two agree, so they cannot drift apart
again silently.

### 5i. Client paging, and the one rail that is not a column

The client list now pages and facets in SQL, the way the event log does. The
mechanical half followed §5b's rules directly. The interesting half was
**Connection**, which is the only rail whose value is not a column: a client is
"wireless" because recent station telemetry carries its MAC, which had been
computed in Go over the fetched rows. That cannot survive paging, so it is an
SQL expression now — a correlated `EXISTS` against the station series.

Three things that came out of it:

- **The derivation exists twice, deliberately, and is tested for agreement.**
  The facet and filter are in SQL; the per-row `connection` field stays in Go
  because it also carries signal and retry. Two definitions of "wireless" is
  precisely how a grid lists a row its own rail did not count, so the wireless
  kind list is one variable passed into both, and both an API test and the
  hardware test assert the counts match the rows.
- **It needed an index nothing else needed.** `series` is uniquely indexed on
  `(device_id, kind, key)` and this query does not know the device, so it could
  not use the leftmost column and scanned `series` once per client row. Migration
  6 adds `series(kind, key)`; the plan now shows a covering index search. The
  test asserts the index exists, because without it nothing fails — it only gets
  slow, and slow is not something a test notices.
- **Measured at 13,000 clients**, seeded locally: 30 ms for a page, 68 ms for
  the wireless filter (which runs the `EXISTS` for both the rows and the
  facets), 28 ms at offset 8500. Verified on the device too: 14 of 14, and the
  facets identical between the full list and a one-row page.

`/clients` no longer returns a `scopes` map — the counts are in `facets` beside
the other two rails, and the response carries `total`, `limit` and `offset`. The
screen fetches its own page now, so `App.tsx` no longer pulls the whole client
inventory every 30 seconds for a screen that is usually not open.

**Also fixed here:** `.run/` was not in `.gitignore`, and `.run/` is the path
§0 tells a reader to run the controller with. Following the documented command
left `keyring.json` untracked in a public repo, one `git add -A` from being
published. `data/` was ignored; the name in the docs was not.

### 5j. Re-probing, and the distinction it exists to protect

Capabilities were probed once, at adoption, and never again. A firmware change
was detected, logged as a warning, and then nothing happened — the stale record
stayed, describing a build that was no longer installed. Now the same detection
triggers a probe, and `POST /devices/{id}/reprobe` does it on demand for the
cases no automatic trigger can see: a package installed, an ACL widened.

**The valuable output is the diff, not the new record.** And the diff had one
job to get right, which is the same job the three-state model has:

> A check that stopped being *possible* is not a capability that stopped
> *existing*.

`Present -> Absent` is a device that lost something. `Present -> NotObservable`
is a narrowed ACL, a removed binary, an ungranted method — on hardware that is
very likely unchanged. They are indistinguishable in the raw states.
`tools/probe.py` collapsed the two and reported "no DSA" for a device with a DSA
switch; a diff that collapses them reports the same lie *as an event, with a
timestamp*, which is worse because it looks like news. So every transition is
classified by what it licenses a reader to conclude — `capability.Effect` — and
that classification, not the raw states, is what the log, the API and the UI
render. Visibility changes log at info and colour muted; only real ones warn.

Three decisions worth not re-litigating:

- **A probe is a burst, so it is not on the poll path.** It runs on a firmware
  change or an operator's request, quiesces the device's poller while it runs
  (the rule an apply follows, for the same reason), and is gated per device.
  Automatic probes have a 10-minute floor; operator-initiated ones have none —
  someone pressing a button has a reason, and refusing them because a
  background probe ran two minutes ago makes the button look broken.
- **A failed probe leaves the old record alone.** It learned nothing. Clearing
  it would make the device unplannable — `deviceCaps` refuses an empty
  record — for a transient network fault. The failure is logged as an event that
  names the consequence, so a misdescribed device is never silent.
- **Sampled and volatile fields are not diffed.** Channel (ACS moves it),
  frequency, and per-radio noise stability (decided by sampling twice, so it can
  differ between two probes of an unchanged radio). Diffing those means every
  probe reports churn, and churn arriving right after an upgrade reads as the
  upgrade's doing.

Verified on the device, read-only, using the existing credential: first probe
`class A Linksys WRT3200ACM`, 8 changes, **0 actionable** — a device does not
gain a radio by being looked at for the first time. Second probe of the same
unchanged device: **no changes at all**, which is the property that makes the
whole thing usable.

### 5k. What diffing two probes found in the probe itself

Comparing two probes turns out to be a test of the probe. Run it twice against
an unchanged device and every non-deterministic determination shows up as a
change — which is how this was found, not by reading the code.

**The bug: an idle channel was reported as a broken driver.** `FeatAirtimeSplit`
is decided by sampling `busy_time`, `rx_time` and `tx_time` twice and checking
the timers advance in proportion. `splitOK` started at `Absent`, and the branch
for an idle channel — which carries the comment *"this sample proves nothing
either way"* — fell straight through to that default. So it recorded proof of
exactly what it had just said it could not prove.

On a driver whose counters work, that makes the feature `Present` when the
channel happened to be busy during the probe and `Absent` when it happened to be
quiet, so re-probing reports the device gaining and losing airtime-split at
random, with a warning each time. The reference device hides it completely:
mwlwifi's counters are genuinely broken, so it is stably `Absent` for a real
reason, and no amount of re-probing this hardware would have shown it.

It is the same collapse the package exists to prevent — "could not determine"
becoming "does not have" — one level in from where the rule is usually applied.
The three-way outcome is now an explicit `judgeSplit`, testable without a device
that happens to be busy, and an undetermined split records `NotObservable` with
a note saying to re-probe while there is traffic. No screen changes: `Buildable`
already accepted only `Present`. What changes is what the record *claims*, which
is what a diff reads and what an operator is told.

**Then the same bug twice more, found by looking for it.** Having seen the shape
once, the other radio-derived features were audited rather than waited for:

- **`FeatSurvey`** was decided by `active_time > 0` with the same `Absent`
  default, so a device with every radio switched off reported that its driver
  cannot do channel utilization — and enabling a radio would then look like the
  device *gaining* a feature. The reference hardware could never show it: both
  radios are up, and one radio with active time settles the device-wide state.
- **`FeatHostapdControl`** was worse, because the two causes are genuinely
  indistinguishable from the error alone. `hostapd.<dev>` only exists while a
  BSS is running, so a missing object means either "hostapd is not managing
  this radio" or "the radio is off". It now uses whether the radio reported
  active time to tell them apart: a *running* radio with no hostapd object is a
  real absence; a dead one demonstrates nothing.

Three instances of one bug, written three times, is a structural problem rather
than three mistakes. The rule is now a `verdict` accumulator — Present wins,
demonstrated absence beats an inconclusive check, anything tried-but-unresolved
is `NotObservable`, and you cannot get an `Absent` out of it without calling
`demonstrated(Absent)`. A device that reports *no radios* still comes out
`Absent`, which is right: there is nothing there to survey, and telling someone
to re-probe their switch would be nonsense.

The reference device reports exactly what it did before the change — survey
present, split absent, hostapd-control present — which is the point. None of
this was visible on hardware that has both radios up and a genuinely broken
driver.

**Also observed:** the reference device reported 2 quirks on one probe and 3 on
the next. The extra one is `noise:stability`, which is decided by sampling the
noise floor twice — and the 2.4 GHz radio on this board swings 40+ dB. That is
real device behaviour, not a bug, and it is the reason quirks are not diffed.
The features they gate are, so a quirk that actually costs a capability is still
reported; the noisy list itself is not. Worth remembering if quirks ever start
driving something directly.

### 5l. Column reorder, and a way to check UI logic without a test runner

Drag-to-reorder was the last half of UI-SPEC §5's "Customize Columns". The
feature is small; what it ran into is not.

**There is no way to click anything here.** Every UI defect this project has
found was found by a human looking at a screen, and shipping a drag interaction
that nobody has dragged is exactly the pattern that produced a sticky header
which had never once been sticky.

So the UI got a test runner: **vitest**, with **happy-dom** and
`@testing-library/react`. Vitest because it reuses the existing vite config and
TypeScript setup rather than needing a parallel one; happy-dom over jsdom for a
materially smaller dependency tree, which matters in a public repo where every
dev dependency is surface. Both packages shipped with critical advisories at the
versions npm resolved first — `npm audit` is worth running after any install
here, and the pinned versions are the patched ones.

**The runner found a real bug within minutes of existing.** happy-dom provides a
`localStorage` object with none of the Storage methods on it, which surfaced
that `useColumnPrefs` read `localStorage.getItem` outside a `try`. Reaching for
localStorage *throws* in some browsers — Safari private mode historically, any
profile with site data blocked — and that read runs inside a `useState`
initialiser. So the failure mode was not "forgets which columns you hid", it was
"blank screen". The guard now wraps the access, not just the parse.

It also cost an hour to a hook-ordering trap worth knowing: **vitest runs
`afterEach` in reverse registration order**, so a teardown hook that throws
stops the ones registered before it from running at all. A broken localStorage
teardown therefore prevented `cleanup` from unmounting, and every test after the
first saw the previous test's DOM — producing failures that pointed everywhere
except at the cause.

**48 tests now**, across the shared grid and the screens. The grid file covers
windowing engaging on a large grid, required columns resisting being hidden,
saved order and hidden-column positions surviving a remount, a drop not also
sorting the column it landed on, and `Unknown` staying distinguishable from
zero. The screen file covers the rules that live above it, and it is worth
saying which ones were worth writing:

- **The mesh editor must not warn "this will be open" when editing an encrypted
  mesh.** The list omits the passphrase, so a round-trip sends an empty one; if
  the editor read that as "open", a rename would strip encryption from a
  wireless backhaul. Both directions are tested — silence on an edit, a warning
  on a genuinely new open mesh — because getting either wrong is bad in a
  different way.
- **A visibility change renders as "not a loss".** The three-state rule at the
  UI layer: rendering `no-longer-observable` the same as `lost` recreates, on
  screen, exactly the bug the capability model exists to prevent.
- **A filter change resets the paging offset**, and a failed refresh keeps the
  last good page rather than blanking the grid — "no clients" and "the fetch
  failed" are different claims. What they do **not** reach: row
height and the sticky header, because happy-dom has no layout engine and
`getBoundingClientRect` returns zeros — the two defects §5b found by eye are
precisely the two this cannot catch. And nothing here says whether a drag
actually starts or whether any of it is usable. That still needs a person.

Rules worth keeping, each of which the checks pin down:

- **Moving right and moving left are not symmetric.** Removing the dragged key
  first shifts the target left into the slot it just left, so "drag one place
  right" silently does nothing unless the insert index compensates.
- **Reordering rewrites the full key list, hidden columns included.** Ordering
  only the visible ones loses the hidden ones' positions, so unhiding a column
  later drops it somewhere the operator never chose.
- **A column a later build ADDS must still appear**, and one a later build
  REMOVES must not break the saved order. Storage outlives any one build.
- **The old storage format migrates.** Preferences were a bare array of hidden
  keys; someone who hid four columns must not get them all back because a later
  build started storing an order alongside.

The picker's ◀ ▶ arrows are not a fallback for the drag — they are the only
path that works without a mouse, and the only one that can move a *hidden*
column, which dragging cannot because there is no header to grab.

### 5m. Hardware breadth: the direction, and the audit

**The stated goal**, 2026-08-14: support as much hardware as possible —
whatever old router is lying around, flashed with OpenWrt and adopted off the
network the way a UniFi device is, working as an access point, a switch, or a
bridge/mesh node with switch support. So anyone can extend their network with
hardware they already own.

That reframes several things that looked settled. This is the audit.

#### What already generalises

- **Poll cadence is not class-dependent.** One conservative default (60 s) for
  everything, plus adaptive widening when a device reports it is busy. The
  DEVICE-BUDGET ceiling is applied to every device rather than computed per
  class, which is the right shape for unknown hardware — a device nobody has
  measured is not polled harder than one that has been.
- **Capability probing is three-state and now structurally cannot invent an
  absence** (§5k). This matters far more with varied hardware than with one
  reference device: everything the controller offers is gated on what the probe
  demonstrated, so a driver nobody has seen degrades to "we could not tell"
  rather than to a wrong claim.
- **Discovery fingerprints on `ubus list`**, which any OpenWrt with rpcd
  answers. No model list to maintain.

#### Fixed here: the role was free text

`Role` was a string, stored exactly as the API received it and compared with
`dev.Role != "gateway"`. Three consequences, all silent:

- `"Gateway"` is not `"gateway"`, so the obvious capitalisation adopted a router
  as an access point — no address, no DHCP, no firewall zone, no forwarding.
- A typo did the same, and the only clue was a preview that did less than
  expected.
- **`"switch"` was accepted and then never consulted.** A device adopted as a
  switch was an access point in every respect that mattered, and would happily
  be sent WLANs.

It is a closed vocabulary now (`internal/model/role.go`), refused at the API
boundary before anything contacts the device, normalised on the way out of the
database, and the renderer asks it what it licenses rather than comparing
strings. A non-wireless role gets no WLANs even where the hardware could carry
them and the site model asks — with an omission naming *both* ways out, since
either the role or the AP-group membership is wrong and the controller cannot
tell which.

**The Adopt screen had no role field at all**, which made a gateway impossible
to adopt from the UI. It has one now, defaulting to access point — the role
that changes least about a device.

#### Fixed here: the role is now checked against the hardware

`roleFit` compares the role an operator chose against what the probe found, at
adoption and on every re-probe. It **warns and never refuses**: the role is a
statement of intent and the probe is a snapshot, and they disagree for good
reasons — radios switched off today and wanted tomorrow, a board file that
under-reports, hardware being prepared before it is cabled. Refusing would turn
a note into a wall, and the operator is the one who knows which of the two is
wrong. What it must not do is stay quiet, and silence was the previous
behaviour: adopt an old router as an access point, get no WLANs, no error, and
a preview that renders nothing.

The three-state rule shows up again inside it. An empty radio list means either
"this device has none" or "we could not ask" — `probeRadios` returns early with
the wireless features `NotObservable` when `iwinfo.devices` is refused, and the
list is empty either way. Those need different messages: one says the role is
wrong, the other says the ACL is narrow, and telling someone to change the role
when the real problem is a refused call sends them to fix the wrong thing.
`FeatSurvey` separates them without a second call.

Verified against the reference device's own registry — 2 radios, survey
present, `br-lan` and `wan` declared — so the premise is checked on real shapes
rather than only on hand-built fixtures: an AP role is silent, a switch role
says plainly that nothing will broadcast.

#### Added here: 802.11s mesh can be detected

The first honest step toward mesh is knowing which devices could carry it, and
that turned out to need measuring rather than reading. Three obvious sources
**cannot** answer it, checked on the reference device 2026-08-14:

| source | what it gives |
|---|---|
| `iwinfo.info`, `luci-rpc.getWirelessDevices` | `hwmodes` are PHY modes (`n`, `ac`) — no supported-interface-mode list |
| `hostapd.<dev> get_features` | `{ht_supported, vht_supported}` and nothing else |
| `file.exec /usr/sbin/iw phy <phy> info` | **ubus status 6** — not in the ACL, and status 6 is permanent |

What does answer it is which **wpad build** is installed, and that grant already
exists. On OpenWrt the 802.11s daemon is a build of wpad: `wpad-mesh-*` carries
mesh with SAE, `wpad-basic-*` and `wpad-mini` deliberately do not. So no ACL
widening was needed — which matters, because a new grant only reaches devices
adopted *after* it, and existing ones would have reported NotObservable forever.

Two things fell out of doing it this way:

- **The reference device uses `apk`, not `opkg`** — `opkg` exits 4 there. The
  probe tries both. And apk glues the version onto the name with a hyphen, so
  splitting on the first hyphen truncates `wpad-mesh-openssl` to `wpad`, which
  would report a mesh-capable device as unclassifiable. The mock now answers
  `apk` in apk format, so that path is exercised without hardware.
- **A full build such as `wpad-openssl` records `NotObservable`, not Present.**
  Those are not named for their feature set and none has been verified here.
  Claiming mesh from a package name that does not settle it is precisely the
  guess §5k caught the probe making elsewhere.

Confirmed on hardware: `mesh-80211s` present, from `wpad-mesh-openssl`.

#### What is still missing, in the order it matters

1. **A WDS/relay bridge is still unmodelled.** The goal names "AP bridge mesh";
   802.11s covers the mesh half, and a WDS bridge is a different mechanism
   (`wds`/4addr rather than `mode mesh`) for the case where the far end is not
   mesh-capable.
2. **The collector now knows what each wireless interface is FOR** — see §5o.
   Applying a mesh would otherwise have reported the backhaul as clients.
3. **Nothing verifies a mesh actually peers.** The controller can configure one
   and can see `mode mesh` on a radio, but there is no mesh-neighbour readout —
   `iw dev <if> mpath dump` / `station dump` would give it, and neither is in
   the ACL. A backhaul you cannot see the health of is half a feature, and this
   is the first thing worth building once there are two nodes.
3. **`classify()` covers three SoC families.** mvebu, filogic/MT7981, MT7621 —
   everything else is `ClassUnknown`, which is *most* old routers: ath79,
   ramips/MT7620, ipq40xx, bcm53xx, lantiq. **Adding targets to that map
   without measuring them would be a guess wearing a measurement's clothes**, so
   the map is unchanged and the second half of this item is done instead: the
   device panel now renders `?` with the board target and the actual
   consequence — polled at the conservative default, no CPU cost claimed —
   rather than a bare question mark that reads as a fault. The C6 was the
   device that made this visible, reporting `class=?` for `ath79/generic`.

   Three UI tests, and the third is the one that matters: a device with **no**
   class is distinct from one whose class is *unmeasured*. "We never asked" and
   "we asked and nobody has measured this" are different claims, which is the
   same distinction the whole capability model turns on.
4. **Class B and C remain unmeasured.** Class C (MT7621) sets the budget and
   every number in this project comes from class A. The budget harness runs
   anywhere; it has only ever run against the comfortable class — and §5k is
   the standing reminder that one reference device hides whole categories of
   bug.

### 5n. Mesh, and why it is not a role

The design decision worth not re-litigating: **a mesh point is a wifi-iface
mode, not a device role.**

The obvious modelling — "mesh" alongside gateway/ap/switch — is wrong in exactly
the way that matters for the hardware this is aimed at. On OpenWrt a mesh point
is a `wifi-iface` with `mode 'mesh'`, and a device carries one *at the same time*
as an AP serving clients. That combination is the whole of "AP bridge mesh with
switch support": an old router extending the network over the air while still
serving clients and its wired ports. A role would make those mutually exclusive
and force a choice between the two things an operator wants together.

Three more rules, each encoded and tested:

- **One band per mesh, not a list.** A WLAN publishes on several bands because a
  client picks one and roams. Mesh nodes peer only within a band, so "the same
  mesh" on 2.4 and 5 GHz is two disjoint backhauls whose halves each look
  healthy. The band is a field, not a slice, and a device without that radio is
  told *why* it cannot join rather than just that it has no 5 GHz.
- **SAE implies required PMF.** 802.11s encryption is SAE, and SAE without
  protected management frames gives peers that refuse each other for reasons
  nobody enjoys debugging.
- **An empty passphrase on update preserves the stored one.** Same rule as
  `SaveWLAN` and sharper here: the API never sends a mesh key back out, so a
  read-modify-write would silently convert an encrypted mesh into an open one —
  and an open mesh is joinable by anyone in radio range, with access to the
  network behind it. An open mesh is still *allowed* (a trusted segment is a
  real case) but the renderer says what it means, once, on the preview.

The capability gate is three-state for a concrete reason: rendering a mesh
interface into a build that cannot carry it produces a radio that silently does
not come up. "Your device cannot" and "we could not find out" send an operator
to different places — different hardware versus a package or an ACL — so the
omissions say which.

**API and UI landed with it.** `GET/POST/DELETE /site/meshes`, and a "Mesh
backhauls" card on the settings screen. The current passphrase rule is the one
worth checking: list and single-mesh reads carry `has_key` and never the key,
including legacy `?reveal=1` requests, and an update with an empty key preserves
the stored one. Explicit clear is separate. Regression coverage exercises
create, list, rename-without-key and the legacy reveal-shaped URL because the
failure it prevents is silent and severe: a rename that quietly drops
encryption leaves a backhaul anyone in radio range can join. The redaction is
source-tested, and §5bf verifies the rebuilt schema-14 UI kept the editor blank
and write-only without saving.

**Verified on hardware, preview only.** Applying an 802.11s interface to the
reference device would write wireless config to the router everything else is
reached through, and a one-node mesh has nothing to peer with. What was checked
is that the plan is built from what the device actually reported: real radios,
real wpad build, real existing config. Result: `oowrt_mesh1_radio0` planned,
flagged as writing a key, with the passphrase itself kept out of the preview.

**The apply and prune path is covered against the mock**, which the preview
could not reach: a mesh applies and is recorded as ours, a second apply of an
unchanged mesh is a no-op, and deleting it from the model plans its removal.
The no-op matters more here than for a WLAN — a mesh section carries a
passphrase, so a plan that never converged would rewrite it on every apply, and
a rewrite briefly drops the interface. Which on a backhaul is the link.

### 5o. What mesh support broke in the collector

Adding a feature creates the conditions for bugs elsewhere, so the question
after landing mesh was what it had just made reachable. One thing, and it was
real.

`discoverIfaces` uses `iwinfo devices`, which lists **every** wireless
interface. The poll then asks each one for `hostapd get_clients`, and on the
focused tier `iwinfo assoclist`. **A mesh point's associated stations are its
peers — other access points.** So the first time anyone applied a mesh, the
backhaul would have been counted as connected users: infrastructure in a list
captioned "your devices", which is the identical complaint client scoping (§5c)
already fixed once for upstream neighbours.

Nothing had gone wrong yet — no mesh has been applied — but the feature that
makes it possible shipped an hour earlier.

The fix needed to know each interface's mode, and the source took measuring
again. `iwinfo.info` reports it per interface (`"Master"` for an AP) but that is
one call per interface. `luci-rpc.getWirelessDevices` gives every interface's
`ifname` and configured `mode` in **one** call, and is already granted — so this
costs one extra call per 15-minute rediscovery, on the cadence that already
exists for the board and the radio list.

Three things worth keeping:

- **The decode is deliberately narrow.** `getWirelessDevices` returns each
  interface's whole UCI config *including `key`, the wireless passphrase, in
  plaintext*. The struct names exactly two fields so the rest is discarded by
  the decoder rather than carried around where a later log line could print it.
  There is a test asserting no passphrase reaches the snapshot.
- **An unknown mode means "assume AP"**, which is what the controller did before
  modes existed. Answering the other way would let a denied call quietly stop
  counting real clients — a number that is too low, with nothing saying so.
- **The survey is still asked of every interface.** Channel utilization is a
  property of the radio's channel, not of what the interface is for, and a radio
  carrying only a mesh point would otherwise report none at all.

### 5p. Standing limitations now have somewhere to be read

The collector has always recorded a `Degradation` for every optional call that
was refused or unreadable, and logged them at **debug**. The reason is sound —
a degradation is a standing property of a device's ACL or driver, not an event,
and logging it per poll would bury everything else. The consequence was that
nobody could ever see one.

That became load-bearing with §5o. Without `luci-rpc.getWirelessDevices` the
poll cannot tell a mesh point from an access point, so it falls back to treating
every interface as an AP — the right fallback, since the alternative silently
stops counting real clients, but it means a device with a narrow ACL quietly
gets the bug the fix was for.

So the device detail carries them now, with **what each one costs**:
`luci-rpc.getWirelessDevices: Permission denied` tells an operator nothing;
"the poll cannot tell a mesh point from an access point, so a mesh backhaul's
peers are counted as clients" tells them everything. Permanent refusals — an
ACL gap — are marked apart from transient ones, because the two call for
different responses.

A device that has never been polled reports **no list at all** rather than an
empty one, which would read as "everything is fine here".

This matters more as the fleet widens. Adopting whatever old routers are around
means varied firmware, varied packages and varied ACLs, and "what can this
controller not see on this device" stops being an edge case and becomes a
routine question.

### 5q. What applying a mesh to real hardware found

Mesh had been verified by preview, by the mock, and by the apply/prune path
against that mock. Then it was applied to the reference device, and the result
is the most useful thing in this file.

**It applied cleanly and did not exist.**

    apply: wrt3200acm -> applied (1 changes) health passed and confirm landed
    on device: oowrt_mesh1_radio0 mode=mesh mesh_id=example-mesh
    interface modes after the apply: map[phy0-ap0:ap phy1-ap0:ap]

uci accepted the config. The apply's health check passed — it asks whether the
SSIDs are on air, and they were. The confirm landed. The section is on the
device. And no mesh point is running.

SSH answered what ubus cannot:

    wpa_supplicant: Could not set interface phy0-mesh0 flags (UP):
                    Operation not permitted
    wpa_supplicant: phy0-mesh0: Failed to initialize driver interface

`ip link` shows `phy0-mesh0 ... state DOWN`. netifd creates the interface and
the driver refuses to raise it.

**Every source a controller can consult said this would work:**

| source | says |
|---|---|
| installed packages | `wpad-mesh-openssl` — the daemon does 802.11s |
| `iw phy0 info` | supported interface modes include **mesh point** |
| `iw phy0 info` | combinations allow `#{AP} <= 16, #{mesh point} <= 1` |
| `uci`, apply, health check, confirm | all succeeded |

Disabling the AP on the same phy changes nothing — it is not a combination
limit. mwlwifi simply will not bring a mesh point up.

This is precisely the category `Quirk` was made for: *present, correctly typed,
plausible, and wrong*. The same driver already supplies three others. So mesh is
gated off on Marvell radios with a quirk that records the measurement, and the
capability is `Absent` on this board **even though the daemon supports it**.

Two consequences worth keeping:

- **A package list is not a capability.** `probeMesh` reads which wpad build is
  installed because nothing else can answer, and that answer is necessary and
  not sufficient. The daemon's capability and the radio's are different
  questions.
- **Absent has two causes, and they send an operator to opposite places.** A
  missing wpad-mesh package is fixable by installing one; a driver that refuses
  is fixable only with different hardware. The renderer's message said "install
  wpad-mesh-*" for both — advice to install a package that was *already
  installed*. It distinguishes them now, and there is a test for each.

**The device was left byte-identical to how it was found**, all four managed
configs, with a dead-man restore armed on the device before anything was written
(§6) and disarmed afterwards. Worth noting that the disarm needed checking: the
first `pkill` did not take, and a `sleep 1200` was still pending a `wifi reload`
at an arbitrary future moment. Arming an undo is half the practice; confirming
it is gone is the other half.

### 5r. Two devices: fast roaming, verified across different silicon

A second router arrived — a TP-Link Archer C6 v2 (US), `ath79/generic`, ath9k +
ath10k — cabled LAN-to-LAN behind the WRT3200ACM. First time this project has
had two.

#### What the second device confirmed immediately

Adoption on hardware it had never seen, and three separate pieces of work firing
correctly for the first time outside a fixture:

- **`class=?`** — `ath79` is not one of the three SoC families `classify()`
  knows, and it says so rather than guessing. §5m item 3, visible in production.
- **`roleFit` diagnosed the radios**: *"adopted as gateway, but this device
  reported no radios… its radios may be disabled — enable one and re-probe."*
  Stock OpenWrt ships radios disabled, so the message written that morning met
  its exact case within hours.
- **The passwordless-root warning fired** — this device accepts any password for
  root, the behaviour ARCHITECTURE §6's probe was redesigned around.

Then, with the radios enabled: **`airtime-split` is Present** — the first
device where it is. mwlwifi's counters are dead, so the WRT3200ACM will never
have it, and §5k's `judgeSplit` correctly found working counters here. Probe
stability also held on a second, entirely different device: second probe,
**unchanged**.

Its wired layout is `bridge="eth0.1" wan="eth0.2"` — swconfig VLANs, not
`br-lan`. Nothing had produced that shape before.

#### Mesh works here, and that validated §5o

`FeatMesh` is **Present** on the C6 and gated **Absent** on the WRT3200ACM —
the two-cause distinction (§5q) exercised from both sides on real hardware.
Applied by hand, the interface came up properly:

    phy0-mesh0: joining mesh example-mesh
    phy0-mesh0: MESH-GROUP-STARTED ssid="example-mesh"
    br-lan: port 4(phy0-mesh0) entered forwarding state

And `iwinfo devices` then lists `phy0-mesh0` alongside the APs — which is
exactly why §5o matters: without the mode filter the poll would ask a mesh point
for its "clients" and report backhaul peers as users.

**The hardware apply test read the modes too early.** A mesh takes ~4 s to come
up and the assertion ran immediately after the apply returned. The product was
right; the test was wrong. Worth remembering when the next one is written: an
apply returning is not the same as a radio being ready.

#### Fast roaming across two APs — the actual verification

The question was whether 802.11r works reliably when adopting other OpenWrt
routers. The renderer emits `ieee80211r`, `mobility_domain`,
`reassociation_deadline` and `ft_over_ds`, and **not** `nas_identifier`, `r0kh`,
`r1kh` or `ft_psk_generate_local` — the four that decide whether FT completes or
falls back to a full reauth. So: look at what the device generates.

**WPA2-PSK.** OpenWrt fills in `ft_psk_generate_local=1`. Every AP derives the
FT keys from the shared passphrase, no key-holder exchange needed.

**SAE / WPA3** — which is the UI default, and where local generation cannot
apply because the key comes from the handshake:

    ft_psk_generate_local=0
    r0kh=ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff * <redacted>
    r1kh=00:00:00:00:00:00 00:00:00:00:00:00 <redacted>
    wpa_key_mgmt=SAE FT-SAE WPA-PSK WPA-PSK-SHA256 FT-PSK

OpenWrt generates wildcard key holders with a key derived from the mobility
domain and the passphrase. **The identical config on the Archer C6 produced the
identical key** — `<redacted>` on Marvell/mvebu and on
Qualcomm/ath79, different drivers, different radio vendors.

That is the whole design working. The controller derives the mobility domain
deterministically so every AP computes the same value without coordination; that
same value plus the passphrase is what OpenWrt hashes into the FT key. And the
reason it holds is `override.go`: SSID, passphrase, security mode and roaming are
**deliberately not overridable per device**, precisely because APs that disagree
about them do not fail cleanly — they fail intermittently.

`nas_identifier` is unset on both. With wildcard key holders hostapd falls back
to the BSSID, so FT still completes; recorded because it is a field the renderer
could set and does not.

**Still unverified: an actual client roaming between them.** The configuration
is right on both APs and the keys match, which is the hard part — but nothing
has yet watched a phone hand off. That needs a client and a `logread` on both
ends, and it is the obvious next thing.

**Automating this is blocked on one thing:** the check reads
`/var/run/hostapd-phy0.conf`, which needs SSH — no ACL grant covers it, and none
should. A two-device integration test would have to drive SSH the way adoption
does.

### 5s. The roam demo: what it proved, and the trap it found

A real client (an iPhone) on `example-managed-wlan`, one SSID across both APs.

**Proved:** the phone held IP `192.0.2.249` throughout, with `DHCPREQUEST`/
`ACK` renewals and no fresh `DHCPDISCOVER`. Same lease, same subnet — the L2
arrangement is right. Both APs carry the same SSID and mobility domain,
same FT key, on all four radios.

**Not proved: an observable fast transition.** A `bss_transition_request` from
the C6 was accepted (`exit=0`) and the phone did leave — then re-scanned and
chose the C6 again, because at that position the C6 was genuinely stronger. That
is correct client behaviour: iOS weighs an 802.11v hint against its own
measurements rather than obeying it. Watching a handoff still needs the target
AP to actually be the better choice.

#### The trap: `txpower=0` wedges mwlwifi until a reboot

Reducing transmit power is the obvious way to force a roam between two APs
sitting side by side. On the WRT3200ACM, setting `txpower=0`:

- was accepted by uci and reported as applied;
- made mwlwifi fail to program keys into hardware
  (`failed to set key ... (-5)`), so the second BSS never came up;
- then took the **whole 5 GHz radio** down —
  `Could not set interface phy0-ap0 flags (UP): I/O error`, and
  `nl80211 driver initialization failed`;
- survived `wifi reload` AND `wifi down/up`.

Worse, `rmmod mwlwifi` (an attempt to recover it) left `modprobe` hung in R
state with no phys at all. **Only a reboot cleared it.**

`iwinfo txpowerlist` advertises `0` as supported on this driver. It is not. Same
shape as the mesh-point claim in §5q: the device asserts a capability, accepts
the configuration, and fails in hardware.

**By contrast the Archer C6 (ath10k) took `txpower=4` cleanly** — radio stayed
up, all four interfaces intact, power applied. So the rule is per-driver, not
universal.

**Consequence for the product.** The controller does not expose transmit power
today. If it ever does, mwlwifi needs a floor above 0 — otherwise it hands an
operator a config that applies successfully, reports healthy, and kills their
5 GHz until they power-cycle the router. That is the §5g failure shape exactly:
a confirmed, "healthy" change that breaks the device.

#### The gap this surfaced: nobody populates the neighbour list

The renderer sets `ieee80211k=1` and `rrm_neighbor_report=1`, so each AP
*advertises* that it can answer neighbour reports — while knowing about no
neighbours. `rrm_nr_get_own` and `rrm_nr_set` are in hostapd's ubus API on both
devices, and a controller is the one component ideally placed to use them: it
knows every AP in a group, their BSSIDs and their channels.

This is the "essentially impossible to maintain by hand across a fleet" claim
the roaming code makes about itself, currently unfulfilled. It is the strongest
candidate for the next real feature.

**It needs an ACL change.** `hostapd.*` currently grants `get_status`,
`get_clients`, `get_features`, `list_bans` and `del_client` — not `rrm_nr_set`
or `bss_transition_request`. And a new grant only reaches devices adopted
*after* it (§5q), so widening the ACL means existing devices report the feature
NotObservable until re-adopted. That is the whole decision. **It was made the
next day — see §5t.**

---

### 5t. Neighbour reports: the first thing built that hand configuration cannot do

Every AP the renderer touches has carried `ieee80211k=1` and
`rrm_neighbor_report=1` since Phase 2, which makes it advertise that it will
answer a client asking "what else is around?". Measured on both reference
devices, every one of them answered with an **empty list**.

That is not a small gap. The whole value of 802.11k is that a client scans three
channels instead of all of them, and a client that asks and gets nothing scans
all of them anyway — so the feature was switched on across the fleet, costing a
beacon information element, and doing nothing.

An AP cannot close it. It knows its own BSS and nothing about the AP down the
hall; the two never talk. Something has to hold the whole fleet and tell each
member about the others, and the controller is the only component that does.
This is the first feature in the project that is not "LuCI, but for several
devices at once" — it is a thing that cannot be configured by hand at all.

#### The controller relays and never constructs

A neighbour report element packs a BSSID, a capability bitfield, an operating
class, a channel, a PHY type and optional subelements. Getting the operating
class alone right means mapping frequency and bandwidth through a regulatory
table.

hostapd already computes it, correctly, for its own BSS, and hands it over
verbatim:

    ubus call hostapd.phy0-ap1 rrm_nr_get_own
    { "value": [ "<ap-bssid>", "example-managed-wlan",
                 "<sanitized-neighbor-report-hex>" ] }

So the controller reads that and relays the bytes untouched. It never parses or
builds one. Doing otherwise would put a second regulatory mapping in the system,
disagreeing with the AP's own on exactly the bands where it matters.

Note the reply is a **positional triple**, not an object. A short array from a
firmware that shapes it differently must read as "could not tell", never as a
neighbour with blank fields — relaying one of those makes an AP answer a client
with a candidate it has no channel to scan for.

#### Why it reconciles instead of applying

Everything else the controller writes is UCI, and survives a reboot because it
is on disk. This does not: `rrm_nr_set` writes hostapd's **runtime** state and
there is no UCI option that carries it.

That is the right shape rather than a limitation to work around. A neighbour
list is derived from where the other APs are *now*, so one written to flash
would be worse than none — an AP confidently sending a client to a BSS that
moved channels a month ago. And it means none of the apply machinery applies:
no rollback (there is nothing to roll back to but the empty list it already
had), no confirm, no health gate, and no taking the fleet-wide apply lock for a
change that cannot make a device unhealthy.

#### The measurement that decided the design

The tempting optimisation is to remember what was last pushed and skip the read.
It does not survive contact with the device:

| after `wifi reload`, having edited one section | neighbour list |
|---|---|
| `phy0-ap1` — the BSS whose config changed | **cleared** |
| `phy1-ap1` — untouched BSS on the same device | **kept, intact** |

Neither "an apply clears everything" nor "an apply clears nothing" is true. So
the current list is **read back** and compared, which makes the operation
idempotent against every cause of loss including ones nobody has thought of — a
hostapd crash, an operator's own `wifi reload`, a device that rebooted between
cycles.

The best evidence it works is the hardware run where the WRT had rebooted and
the C6 had not: **2 updated on the WRT, 2 unchanged on the C6**, all four BSSes
ending with three neighbours. The reconciler repaired exactly what was broken.

**Comparison is order-insensitive, and that is measured rather than preferred.**
hostapd returns `rrm_nr_list` in its own storage order — on both devices neither
insertion order nor sorted. An order-sensitive comparison reports every list as
changed on every cycle and pushes to every AP forever: a reconciler that never
converges, indistinguishable from a broken one except that it also spends the
request budget.

#### What it costs

Per device per cycle: one `iwinfo.devices`, one batched request carrying two
calls per wireless interface, and — only when something differs — one more to
push. At the 15-minute cadence that is under a tenth of DEVICE-BUDGET's
one-request-per-minute allowance, and in the steady state the third request
never happens. Requests are attributed to the device's Management Overhead
readout, the same rule discovery follows.

Triggers are the 15-minute loop, one cycle at startup (a controller that just
started is most likely starting because something restarted, which is exactly
when the lists are empty), and after every apply.

#### The ACL decision §5s left open

Made, and narrowly:

| granted | not granted |
|---|---|
| `rrm_nr_get_own`, `rrm_nr_list` (read) | `bss_transition_request` |
| `rrm_nr_set` (write) | `rrm_beacon_req` |

The controller tells APs about each other and leaves the roam decision to the
client. Steering a client is a different feature with client-visible effects and
a policy behind it, and granting the method "while we are here" would put the
capability on every device ahead of the decision to use it.

Widening the ACL only reaches a device through adoption, so both devices were
re-adopted — which is the real upgrade path, and the integration test walks it
rather than arranging the end state by hand.

#### Three defects, none found by hardware

- **`verdict`'s empty default is `Absent`.** Right for a device that reported no
  radios — there is nothing there to give a neighbour list to — and wrong for
  one whose hostapd could not be reached, where nothing was recorded because
  nothing could be asked. A denied `get_status` therefore reported neighbour
  support as *absent*. Found by a test written specifically to check that one
  cause does not produce two symptoms. The fix ties the neighbour verdict to the
  hostapd verdict on the same radio, since you cannot learn about a method on an
  object you could not reach.
- **`Distribute` did not deduplicate by BSSID.** A list naming the same BSSID
  twice is malformed. The controller cannot assume its inventory is clean — one
  physical AP reached the function under two device rows (below) — so the
  identity that matters on the wire is made unique. Fixing it needed a matching
  two-value lookup in the caller, because *"no plan, another row covers this"*
  and *"planned with an empty list, clear your neighbours"* are different
  instructions, and treating the first as the second overwrites a correct list
  with nothing.
- **The mock advertised a hostapd with no `get_status`.** `OBJECTS` had
  duplicate `hostapd.wlan0` and `hostapd.wlan1` keys and Python kept the last,
  silently discarding the full method lists. Invisible, because the dispatcher
  answers `hostapd.*` before consulting that table — while `ubus list`, which is
  what discovery and the capability probe fingerprint on, read the truncated
  version.

#### And one the lab found: a fleet can hold the same AP twice

Adoption identifies a device by its `br-lan` MAC. The test seed helpers wrote
MACs as **literals** — one of them the box's WAN-side address, the other a
radio's — so a seeded row and a real adoption of the same physical box became
two devices in the inventory, both marked adopted, both pointed at
`192.0.2.1`. One AP polled twice, against a budget of one request a minute.

The helpers ask the device now, through the same function the real path uses. A
helper that computes an identity its own way produces rows that look adopted and
are not the rows adopting would produce.

**Still open, and worth a decision:** adoption refuses a device whose MAC it has
already seen, and has no guard on *host*. Nothing stops the same box being
adopted twice under two identities if its identifying interface ever changes —
which a bridge rename or a board file change would do.

#### And one more the hardware found: a partial cycle must not remove

One AP was still bringing its radios up while the other was reconciled, and the
healthy AP was handed a list with the booting one **deleted from it**. The
reconciler had done exactly what it was told: the missing AP contributed no
BSSes, so the computed table did not contain them, so they were removed.

That is the project's own rule broken at the fleet level. A device that could
not be read is not a device with no radios — and the failure modes here are not
symmetric. A stale neighbour costs a client one wasted scan; a missing one costs
it the full scan 802.11k exists to avoid.

So a cycle in which any device **errored** may add and refresh, and may not
remove (`roaming.Union`). Removals resume the moment a complete read succeeds —
verified: after the partial cycle had shrunk the C6's lists, the next complete
cycle repaired all four BSSes back to three neighbours each.

A device that was *skipped* does not make a cycle incomplete. It was reached, or
its own capability record ruled it out; either way its APs are not silently
missing from the table, and treating that as incomplete would mean a fleet with
one un-upgraded device could never remove a neighbour again.

#### Verified

Two APs, two bands each, one SSID, on mvebu/mwlwifi and ath79/ath10k:

| | |
|---|---|
| BSSes carrying `example-managed-wlan` | 4 |
| neighbours each ended up with | 3 — every other BSS, and never itself |
| second cycle | 0 updated, 4 unchanged |
| second cycle from a *fresh database* | 0 updated, 4 unchanged |

The fresh-database run is the one worth keeping: the reconciler holds no state
between runs, so a controller that has lost its database still converges the
fleet from what the devices themselves report.

One more thing the fault conditions demonstrated for free. While the WRT's
hostapd was wedged, its re-probe recorded `neighbor-report: not-observable` —
**not absent**. The three-state rule held under a real fault, on a device that
genuinely has the capability, without anyone arranging it.

**And then it ran unattended.** A controller left up for an hour logged nine
lines in total, none of them a distribution: four 15-minute cycles found the
fleet converged and said nothing, which is what the "only a cycle that changed
something is worth a line" rule is for. Checked against the devices rather than
inferred from the silence — every managed BSS still holding three neighbours,
every unmanaged SSID still holding none. Quiet because there was nothing to do,
which is the only version of quiet worth having.

### 5u. A factory reset, seen from the controller

The reference device was factory reset mid-session. That is a real lifecycle
event — someone recovering a misbehaving router does it without telling their
controller — and the controller handled it badly enough to be worth fixing on
the spot.

A reset removes the rpcd login and the ACL file **and leaves everything else
intact**. So the controller is left holding a sealed credential for a box that
is on the network, healthy, answering, and has never heard of it. What that
produced was `ubus session.login: PERMISSION_DENIED`, once a minute, forever.

That message is also what an operator sees when a password was rotated, when an
ACL was narrowed, and when the keyring is wrong. Four different problems behind
one sentence, and only one of them has an obvious fix.

`Connect` now adds a diagnosis when the device answers discovery's
unauthenticated `list` and still refuses the credential. Three things about how
it does it:

- **It adds to the error rather than replacing it.** The login failure is still
  what happened, and callers matching on it have to keep working.
- **It says nothing when the device did not answer.** Telling someone to
  re-adopt a router that is merely unplugged sends them to rebuild something
  that only needs to come back. The check is asymmetric on purpose: answering
  proves the credential is the problem, and silence proves nothing.
- **It reuses `discovery.Probe` rather than rolling its own call.** A
  hand-written `session.list` is refused by a stock ACL, and a refusal is not
  the question being asked.

Recovery is un-adopt then adopt, and un-adopt must be **forced**: the footprint
it exists to remove is already gone, so phase 2 can never report a clean
removal. That is exactly the case §5b's `Force` fix was for, met for real. The
two-AP setup helper now does it by itself.

#### A factory reset also breaks LuCI, and that is not the controller's doing

Found while the WRT was being investigated for something else, and worth
recording because anyone following this project's adopt/reset lifecycle will
meet it. After the reset the web interface returned **403** on
`/cgi-bin/luci` while `/` and HTTPS served fine.

Stock `/etc/config/uhttpd` carries `lua_prefix` pointing at
`/usr/lib/lua/luci/sgi/uhttpd.lua`. On LuCI 26.x that file does not exist —
LuCI is ucode now — and `uhttpd-mod-lua` is not installed. The `ucode_prefix`
line that makes it work is added by `luci-base` through a uci-defaults script,
which runs **at package install and not on a factory reset**. So the reset
restores the base config and LuCI's addition never comes back. The handler
itself, `/usr/share/ucode/luci/uhttpd.uc`, is present the whole time and simply
unwired.

    uci del uhttpd.main.lua_prefix
    uci add_list uhttpd.main.ucode_prefix='/cgi-bin/luci=/usr/share/ucode/luci/uhttpd.uc'
    uci commit uhttpd && /etc/init.d/uhttpd restart

Nothing in oonfeeWRT causes or fixes this — it is recorded so that a reset
during an adoption experiment does not get mistaken for something the
controller did, which is exactly how the first ten minutes of finding it went.

#### The mock was wrong about the one call discovery depends on

Found while testing the above. `tools/mock_ubus.py` answered `list` with `{}`
unless its first parameter was 32 characters long — i.e. unless it looked like a
session token.

That is backwards from the device. `list` needs **no session**, and that is
precisely why discovery uses it (§5a): no credential, no session, no failed-login
record, and it returns the whole object graph. Discovery sends `params: ["*"]`,
so against the mock it saw an empty object list and graded a perfectly good
OpenWrt box as merely *reachable* rather than *OpenWrt*.

Nothing caught it because discovery's own tests use their own fixture. It
surfaced only when a daemon test asked discovery to identify the mock — one
component's fixture being checked by a different component's expectations, which
is the only thing that finds this class of bug. Same family as §6's "a mock that
is easier to write than the real thing is testing the wrong thing", one level
further out: the mock was not simpler here, it was *inverted*, and every test
that never asked this question passed either way.

### 5v. The browser pass, and the four things it found

Item 1 of the do-next list, done 2026-08-16 by an operator opening the screens
while I watched the daemon log. Four defects in one sitting, and the useful part
is that **not one of them was reachable by any test in the repo**.

#### What was confirmed working

Worth recording, because a pass that only lists faults reads as a broken build.
The neighbour card rendered exactly as designed — `example-managed-wlan` named, "4
already correct", both APs, `knows 3 neighbours` on every BSS. The unmeasured
class explained itself on the C6 and stayed a bare `A` on the WRT. Both
re-probes reported `neighbor-report` present and no changes on a second run.
**The sticky header stays pinned when a long grid scrolls** — the defect that
was silently broken for the entire life of the project once (§5b), checked by
eye because happy-dom has no layout engine and never will.

And the daemon log carried **zero warnings or errors** for the whole session,
which is the half of this that a screenshot cannot show.

#### 1. The grid people look at most could not be reordered

Reported as "I tried to drag the column header, nothing happens" — on Devices,
which was the one `DataGrid` with no column preferences. Clients and Logs had
them. Without `onPrefsChange` the header is not `draggable` at all, so there was
no reorder, no picker, and not even the tooltip that says dragging is possible.

**Why it survived a suite that tests dragging.** Every drag test fires
`fireEvent.dragStart` directly, and fireEvent dispatches the event whatever the
DOM says. They all passed against a header a real mouse could never pick up:
they proved the *drop handler* worked and said nothing about whether a drag can
*start*. §5l predicted this in so many words — *"nothing here says whether a drag
actually starts"* — and then it happened anyway, which is the difference between
naming a gap and closing it.

`draggable` is asserted directly now, in both directions. A grid that cannot
reorder must not advertise that it can, so the absent case is pinned too.

#### 2. "Radios" was listing BSSes

The device panel iterated `stats.aps` — one row per broadcasting interface —
under a heading that said Radios. On a two-radio AP carrying two SSIDs that
rendered **four radios**. Two rows read `example-managed-wlan` and were distinguishable
only by a channel number. And the airtime figure appeared **twice per radio**.

That last one is the §5h shape again: one quantity presented as two
measurements. Channel occupancy belongs to the channel, and every BSS sitting on
it reports the same number correctly — but printing it once per BSS invites the
reader to believe two radios were measured. It reads *"channel 1 is 58.0%
busy"* now, once per interface, with the interface named.

#### 3. "Packages installed: none" was true and unreadable

It means packages **the controller** installed — always none, reported rather
than omitted precisely so ARCHITECTURE §0's "we install nothing on your router"
can be checked instead of believed. The tooltip said so. Nobody hovers. Under
that label the value was a claim about the *device*, which for any real router
is plainly false, so the field looked broken. Now "Packages we installed".

The general shape: **a correct value under a wrong label is a wrong readout.**
The `packages_note` was doing real work and reaching nobody.

#### 4. The keyring passphrase has no recovery path, and it showed

Not a UI defect, and the most operationally serious of the four. Starting the
daemon by hand prompted `Operator passphrase:` — the key that unseals the device
credentials — which was generated in a previous session and exists only in the
session scratchpad. There is nothing an operator could type. The prompt gives no
hint that a file is the intended path, and the failure is a flat "the passphrase
is wrong, or the keyring file has been corrupted".

Nothing was lost here (both devices re-adopt over SSH), but the shape is worth
naming: **the only copy of the key to every device credential lives in a
directory that has already been wiped once during this project.** §7 documents
`-passphrase-file`; the running daemon does not mention it. A prompt that cannot
be answered should say what would answer it.

### 5w. Mesh backhaul health

§5m called this "the first thing worth building once there are two nodes", and
it was the last thing the mesh feature was missing: the controller could
configure a backhaul and could see that an interface was in mode `mesh`, and had
no idea whether anything crossed it.

Designed with a fan-out of readers and an adversarial judge panel, then built
by hand from the synthesis. Two of its claims were checkable and both were true;
one of its judgements was overridden. What follows is what survived contact.

#### The deliverable is a closed vocabulary, not a struct of nullables

Thirteen states, one per way of being right or wrong, decided once in
`internal/meshlink` and switched on at the render boundary. The alternative —
peer count, interface up, capability present, handed to a screen that decides
what they mean together — has failed twice in this project already: a count
computed from whatever happened to be loaded (§5b), and one question answered
two ways on two screens (§5h). A UI that re-derives health from nullables is a
second implementation of this logic, and two implementations drift.

**The order of the ladder is the design.** Every rung is reached only when the
ones above did not apply, so the first state that matches is also the first
thing worth doing something about. A device whose driver will not run a mesh
must never be described as having zero peers: the count would be true and the
sentence useless, because the thing to fix is three rungs earlier.

Two judgements worth defending:

- **A count without peer-link state is its own state**, not a healthy one. It
  cannot distinguish a working backhaul from one stuck mid-handshake.
- **Zero peers on the only node of a mesh is toned down.** On the one
  mesh-capable device here it is correct and permanent, and rendering it red
  forever is precisely how a screen teaches people to ignore red.

#### It costs no device request, and that is why it works this way

| fact | source | cost |
|---|---|---|
| can this device carry a mesh | capability record via `render.MeshGate` | none |
| was one applied to it | `owned_sections` (applied AND confirmed) | none |
| which interface it is | `getWirelessDevices`, already on the 15-min slot | none |
| is it up | `network.device status`, already call #2 of every poll | none |
| how many peers, and their link state | `iw dev <if> station dump`, 15-min slot | one exec |

The liveness row is the one worth staring at: **`phy0-mesh0 state DOWN` has been
arriving in every snapshot this project has ever taken.** §5q went looking for
it over SSH. Only the join was missing.

`owned_sections` is load-bearing rather than an optimisation. Observation alone
can never distinguish a mesh whose interface the driver refused to create from a
device nobody asked to run one — so without the record of what was applied,
§5q is unreportable in principle.

#### Where the design was overridden

DEVICE-BUDGET disagrees with itself: §3.2's rule says `file.exec` belongs "at the
slow-loop interval, never the fast one", while its feature table lists
`iw station dump` as focused-rate. The synthesis resolved toward the table,
gated on re-running the budget harness. This resolves toward the rule, and the
gate becomes unnecessary: a mesh peer appears when somebody unplugs a node or a
link finally establishes, not on the timescale of somebody watching a screen.

`iwinfo.assoclist` is **deliberately not used** even though it is already
granted, returns the same peers as structured JSON, and needs no process spawn.
It carries no `mesh plink`. That single field is the entire difference between a
count and a health reading.

#### The parser is written against a capture, not against the format

`iw station dump` output was taken verbatim from the C6 on 2026-08-16, and it
contains something nobody would have guessed:

    inactive time:	7700 ms          <- key, tab, value
    signal:  	-37 [-37, -47, -77, -77] dBm
    beacon interval:100              <- NO whitespace at all
    short slot time:yes

A parser splitting on `":\t"` drops every field the device chose not to pad —
and on a device that formats `mesh plink` that way, it would drop the one field
the whole judgement turns on. Splitting on the first colon and trimming both
halves is the only shape that reads both.

#### Four bugs, and only one was findable without hardware

1. **An apply invalidated the interface cache immediately**, and the refetch
   landed in the four to six seconds *before* the new interface exists. It
   cached the absence and held it for the full 15-minute cadence — so every
   successful mesh apply would have shouted `interface-absent`, critical, about
   a backhaul that came up fine two seconds later. A second, delayed re-read
   fixes it. §5r's lesson arriving for the third time: **an apply returning is
   not a radio being ready.**
2. **The peer exec was gated on `needIfaces()`**, and the mode map that says
   which interface is a mesh comes *from* that fetch. The poll that learns about
   the mesh has not got the modes yet; the poll that has them is not re-reading.
   It could never fire. Its own cadence now.
3. **The exec iterated `iwinfo.devices`, which did not list the live
   `phy0-mesh0`** — measured — while `getWirelessDevices` did. Two sources of
   "which interfaces exist" disagree, and only one of them knows about meshes.
   §5o chose `getWirelessDevices` for modes and this had quietly chosen the
   other list for the same question.
4. **"Expect a peer" counted devices in the group**, so the C6 sat at warning
   permanently because the WRT is in that group and cannot run a mesh at all.
   It counts devices that could actually *carry* one now. Left alone, the
   readout would have committed the exact failure it was built to avoid.

#### What is verified, and what cannot be

Verified on both devices, end to end through real polls: the WRT reaches
`not-buildable` carrying the driver's own sentence — §5q's gate working from the
health side rather than the render side — and the C6 reaches a live
`phy0-mesh0`, then a **demonstrated** zero peers, toned normal with the reason.
The test waits for the reading to settle rather than for a fixed time, and
starts the collector *before* the apply on purpose: started afterwards there is
no stale cache to invalidate and it would pass on a lucky ordering.

**Not verified, and not verifiable here: any peered state.** Mesh is Present
only on the C6 and gated off on the WRT, so nothing in this project has ever
watched two nodes find each other. `peered`, `peering` and `plink-unknown` are
unit-tested against constructed input and have never met hardware. That needs a
third device or a WRT replacement, and until then the most interesting half of
this ladder is theory.

### 5x. The wireless uplink (WDS), and what the hardware said about it

The last unmodelled piece of the stated direction: the router in the room with
no ethernet run to it. A mesh covers that when both ends can carry 802.11s;
this covers it when they cannot — which, measured, includes one of the two
devices here (§5q).

Built end to end in one pass: capability, model, renderer, store (migration 8),
API, and a screen. Then reviewed adversarially, then met hardware. Each of those
three stages found something the previous one had not, and the hardware finding
is the one that decides what this feature is worth.

#### The modelling decision

**A device property plus a WLAN flag, not a Bridge object.** The two ends are
not symmetric and do not belong to the same owner: the AP end is a property of a
network ("this one accepts wireless bridges") and applies to every AP publishing
it; the station end is a property of one device ("this one has no cable"). A
Bridge object forces an operator to describe a relationship where the real
decision is two independent facts, and breaks the moment a second device wants
to join the same way.

Credentials are never restated on the uplink — it references a WLAN, so the
SSID, passphrase and security mode live in one place. Same rule `override.go`
enforces, same reason: a bridge whose key drifts fails the way a client with a
stale password fails.

#### Two hazards the controller cannot check, so it says them

**The loop.** A station bridged into `br-lan` on a device that is ALSO cabled is
a layer-2 loop, OpenWrt bridges ship with STP off, and the symptom is a network
that stops working rather than an error — §5g's shape exactly. The controller
cannot see the far end of a cable and does not pretend to: it states the
condition on the preview and on every API response, and leaves it to whoever can
see the room.

**Removing one is editing the road while driving down it.** On a device with no
cable the station IS the route. `applyengine.IsUplinkSection` makes pruning it
count as touching the management path, so it needs an explicit acknowledgment
rather than going through as an ordinary wireless change.

#### What the review caught, and what it cost to ignore one finding

Four lenses, two skeptics per finding. Two criticals, both real, both latent —
nothing could create an uplink yet, so they would have gone live in the very
next commit:

- **`Site.Validate` never iterated `Uplinks`**, so every sentence
  `Uplink.Validate` produces was unreachable. §6's guard that cannot fire.
- **`TouchesManagementPath` covered only `network` and `firewall`.** A wireless
  section was never a management path — until an uplink, where it is the only
  one. Matched on the section name now rather than a caller-set flag, with the
  coupling pinned by a test from render's side, because applyengine cannot
  import render.

And one finding I read and did not act on: *what if an uplink names a device
that also serves that WLAN?* Hardware charged me for it within the hour.

#### What hardware found

**Turning the AP half off did not turn it off.** The renderer omitted `wds` when
the flag was false, and a plan compares only the keys it writes — so whatever
was last applied stayed. Measured: after switching it off and applying, both
access points still carried `wds='1'`. An AP still accepting 4-address frames
while the screen says it does not is a security posture nobody chose. It writes
`"0"` explicitly now, as `ft_over_ds` three lines above it already did. **My own
test asserted the buggy behaviour** — it checked the key was absent, which is
what the code did rather than what it should do.

**A device cannot bridge to a network it publishes.** The C6 was in the AP group
serving `example-managed-wlan` and told to join it, so a station came up on the radio
already carrying that SSID and sat at channel 0. Refused now rather than warned
about, because nothing in that config looks wrong.

#### And the finding that decides the feature's status

**Station mode does not work on the Archer C6 at all.** Not 4-address; not the
controller. Isolated three ways before being written down:

| ruled out | how |
|---|---|
| the controller | a hand-written UCI section fails identically |
| 4-address framing | fails the same with `wds` removed |
| AP/STA concurrency | fails with every AP on that radio disabled, station alone |

The interface comes up in Client mode at channel 0 with 0 dBm, `iw link` says
"Not connected", and a scan returns **zero BSSes**. Every signal a controller can
consult says it should work: `wpad-mesh-openssl` installed, `wpa_supplicant`
running with a control socket open for that interface, and `iw phy` declaring
`#{ managed } <= 16` alongside the APs on one channel.

That is §5q's shape on a second driver — advertised, accepted, refused.

**Deliberately NOT recorded as a Quirk.** A quirk gates the feature off, and one
board is not a driver: this could be the board, that firmware build, or ath10k
generally, and those three send an operator to three different places.
`FeatWirelessUplink` stays Present from the package list, and the note now says
what Present means — *the software is there, worth trying* — and **describes how
it fails**, because a station that comes up and never associates looks like a
dozen other problems and cost an afternoon here.

#### Status

Complete in code, tested from unit through API and UI, and **unproven on this
hardware for a sharper reason than mesh**. Mesh needs a second mesh-capable
node; this needs a device whose radio will run a station at all. The feature
rests on the assumption that some OpenWrt device can, which is well founded and
now explicitly untested here.

### 5y. Asking the air, and the adoption bug that fell out of it

§0 records a WRT3200ACM that beaconed `example-stale-wlan` — an SSID present in no
configuration anywhere on the device — for about fourteen hours while
`/etc/config/wireless`, hostapd's running conf, `iwinfo`, ubus **and the
kernel's own `iw dev info`** all reported `example-managed-wlan`. Every verification this
controller had was on the wrong side of the driver.

`internal/onair` is the answer: a second radio. A beacon is a physical thing and
cannot be produced by a stale config or a confused daemon, so the fleet
cross-checks itself — each device scans, and what it hears is compared against
what the others claim to broadcast.

**Verified on both APs, 2026-08-16:** six BSSes, every one confirmed by the
other device's radio, zero faults. The WRT's two witnessed by the C6, the C6's
four witnessed by the WRT.

#### Almost all of the design is about not crying wolf

A fleet that lights up red is a fleet nobody looks at, and access points placed
for coverage routinely cannot hear each other. So the negative state is
`Unheard`, never `Absent`, and four measured or known reasons a scan misses a
live BSS are enumerated in the package comment — including one from this lab:
**the C6's 2.4 GHz radio returned 20 BSSes while its 5 GHz radio, serving an AP,
returned zero.** Not a quiet band; a scan that never happened. `BandsCovered`
exists so that silence cannot become evidence.

Exactly one combination is ever a fault: a BSSID another radio **did** hear, on
a band that **was** scanned, broadcasting a **different SSID** than its own
device claims. No distance or timing story explains that away.

It is operator-initiated and on no timer. A scan takes a radio off-channel,
which whoever is using the network feels — unlike the capability probe, which is
merely expensive.

#### The bug it exposed, which is bigger than the one it was built for

`probeRadios` enumerated `iwinfo.devices` — which lists **broadcasting
interfaces, not radios**. A device with no `wifi-iface` therefore recorded
**zero radios**, and the renderer then refused to give it one ("device has no
5g radio"), so it could never get an interface for the radios to become visible
through.

**Stock OpenWrt ships its radios disabled.** So this hit every freshly adopted
router: the controller could not bring a stock device into service at all,
which is this project's entire stated direction. The C6 only ever worked
because its radios had been enabled by hand before adoption — the one accident
that hid this for the life of the project.

Measured on the WRT with two working radios and no WLAN:

| source | says |
|---|---|
| `iwinfo.devices` | `[]` |
| `luci-rpc.getWirelessDevices` | radio0 (5g, ch36) and radio1 (2g, ch1), both up |
| `/sys/class/ieee80211/` | phy0, phy1 |

The radio list now comes from `getWirelessDevices`, which is keyed by radio and
answers when nothing is broadcasting, and which the ACL already granted. iwinfo
still supplies the per-interface detail where an interface exists.

**Two corrections fell out of it, both the capability model's own cardinal error
reached sideways.** With no radios to inspect, the Marvell mesh quirk could not
fire, so `FeatMesh` flipped from correctly-Absent to **Present** on a driver that
demonstrably will not run a mesh point — an unrunnable check reported as a clean
bill. It records NotObservable now. And a radio with no interface has no
frequency, so `radiosByBand` skipped it entirely; it falls back to the
configured band, because "this device has no 5 GHz radio" about hardware sitting
right there is a claim no apply could ever fix.

End to end: the WRT went from *"device has no 2g radio"* to `applied (2 changes)
health passed and confirm landed`, with `example-managed-wlan` on both radios.

### 5z. The adoption bug, pinned — and what a real roam exposed on the way

**Done 2026-08-16.** §5y's bug was proven only by hardware and had no test. It
now has two, one per half, because **either half alone would have hidden it**:
the probe must find radios on a device with no interfaces, and the renderer must
then give those radios a WLAN despite their having no frequency. Both are
mutation-verified — putting each bug back reproduces its own symptom and no
other (`"a device with disabled radios reported none at all"` /
`"got 0 section(s)"`).

Writing the test found the fixture had the same blind spot **in two places**,
which is why no test had ever caught this: `iwinfo.devices` was a hardcoded
constant that could not go empty, and `WIRELESS_DEVICES` carried no radio-level
config at all — no `band`, no `channel`. Those live on the *radio*, and they are
the only facts that survive a device having no interfaces. **A fixture that
cannot express the broken state cannot catch the bug.**

#### A real roam, and the grid that could not say where the client went

A client roamed C6 → WRT under 802.11r while the monitor was running
(`AP-STA-CONNECTED ... auth_alg=ft`). The obvious next question — does the
Clients grid now say WRT? — had no confident answer, and chasing it found a bug
with nothing to do with roaming.

`recentStations` scanned every station rollup flat and let the last row win. Two
APs report the same MAC in one five-minute bucket on every roam, and also
whenever an operator opens two device pages within five minutes, since a focused
poll is the only thing that produces station telemetry at all. **Whichever
collector wrote second took the client.** Proven rather than argued: hold both
readings fixed, reverse only the write order, and the client moves to the other
AP. The same grid, refreshed, could relocate a stationary client.

Two more consequences came from the same scan. Each field was overwritten
independently, so one row could carry **one AP's identity, a second's signal and
a third's retry rate** — three sources, one plausible-looking row, undetectable
from outside. And a retry row could carry the attribution alone, so an AP with
no RSSI reading for a client could still be named as the AP it was on.

The AP is now chosen in SQL, per MAC, before any metric is read: newest bucket,
then strongest signal, then `device_id` purely so a real tie is stable. Retry is
excluded from the ranking — a retry percentage says nothing about which radio a
client is near.

#### Measured, so nobody chases it again

**mwlwifi logs two errors on every successful FT association** and they are
noise:

```
phy0-ap0: nl80211: kernel reports: key addition failed
nl80211: NL80211_ATTR_STA_VLAN (addr=… ifname=phy0-ap0 vlan_id=0) failed: -2
```

Both land in the same second as the association. The client was then
`authorized/authenticated/associated` and moved **539 KB in 93 seconds**, so the
key is installed and traffic flows. Checked rather than inferred, because "key
addition failed" reads exactly like the cause of a connects-but-no-traffic bug.

#### The monitor gave two false signals before it gave a true one

Both worth stating, because a watchdog that lies is worse than none:

1. It counted **any** `daemon.err` as a driver fault, so it reported a FAULT for
   the successful roam above. It now matches the actual wedge signature
   (`nl80211_recv_beacons->nl_recvmsgs failed: -5`, or hostapd in D state).
2. It held the ssh command in a string and ran `$S …`. **zsh does not word-split
   an unquoted parameter**, so the whole command line became one command name,
   every probe returned empty, and the monitor reported the router UNREACHABLE
   while it was answering fine. A false "down" is the same failure as a false
   fault.

The WRT has now run **49 minutes with a clean signature**, past the ~28-minute
mark it wedged at before.

### 5aa. The WRT failure, diagnosed — it is the 5 GHz firmware

**Caught live 2026-08-16, 52 minutes after a clean boot.** The user asked to
watch rather than act, and the watch paid: this is the first time the failure
has been observed from the inside while it was happening.

**The causal chain, measured in order:**

```
22:08:21  ieee80211 phy0: cmd 0x801d=MEMAddrAccess timed out   <- CAUSE
          (return code 0x001d, then every ~20s, forever)
22:09:01  nl80211: nl80211_recv_beacons->nl_recvmsgs failed: -5  <- 40s later
          hostapd (pid 1793) in D state, ubus silent
```

`MEMAddrAccess` is the mwlwifi driver failing to reach the **88W8964 firmware on
phy0**. Everything previously treated as the fault is downstream of it: the
netlink `-5` is `EIO` from a driver that cannot reach its firmware, and hostapd's
uninterruptible sleep is it blocking on that driver.

**The blocking is global, not per-radio.** A bounded probe (watchdog per call,
so a hang is measured rather than inferred):

| call | result |
|---|---|
| `iw dev phy1-ap0 station dump` (2.4 GHz, first call) | **completed, 1s** |
| `iw dev phy0-ap0 station dump` (5 GHz) | **blocked** |
| `iw dev phy1-ap0 info` (2.4 GHz, after the above) | **blocked** |

phy1's firmware is healthy — it answers until a phy0 call is outstanding, and
then it does not. nl80211 operations serialise, so one stuck phy0 command holds
the lock against every radio. `kill -9` does not release it; D state is
uninterruptible. **One hung radio takes the entire wireless control plane with
it, including the working one.**

#### This explains the 14-hour lie

§0's most confusing event — the WRT beaconing `example-stale-wlan`, an SSID in no
config anywhere, while `/etc/config`, the hostapd conf, `iwinfo`, ubus and `iw
dev info` all said `example-managed-wlan` — now has a mechanism. The control plane
accepted and reported the new config; **phy0's firmware was hung and never
applied it**, and kept transmitting from the last configuration it had actually
loaded. Every reader was telling the truth about what it had been told. Only the
air knew. That is precisely the gap `internal/onair` (§5y) was built to close,
and it turns out to have a specific, reproducible cause rather than a mystery.

#### A correction to §0

§0 states the trigger was caught directly: `STA … deauthenticated due to
inactivity`, then `-5` 66 seconds later. **That does not hold.** In this
occurrence there was no deauth at all — the last wireless event was a routine
`STA-OPMODE-*` change 8.5 minutes earlier, then silence, then the firmware
timeout. The deauth was a coincidence in one sample. The honest statement is
that **no trigger has been identified**; what is now known is the failing
component and the order of collapse.

Timing is not fixed either: the earlier wedge was ~28 minutes in, this one 50.

#### What this rules out

No ubus call causes it (already disproved by controlled repeat, §6). Nothing the
controller does can prevent it, and nothing it does can recover it — the recovery
is below the level any management protocol reaches. **This is not a software
problem this project can fix.** The device is a firmware-faulty AP and should be
treated as one: useful as a hostile test subject, not as a reference.

#### The watchdog was wrong three times before it was right

Kept in `tools/wrt-wedge-watch.sh` now, with all three fixed:

1. Counted **any** `daemon.err` as a fault, so it fired on a successful 802.11r
   roam (§5z).
2. Held the ssh command in a string and ran `$S …`; **zsh does not word-split an
   unquoted parameter**, so every probe returned empty and it reported the
   router UNREACHABLE while it was answering.
3. Matched D state on `$3` of busybox `ps w`, which is the **VSZ** column, not
   `STAT` (`$4`). It printed `hostapd_D=0` throughout, while hostapd was in D
   state the entire time. A watchdog reading the wrong column reports healthy
   through the exact failure it exists to catch.

It now watches `MEMAddrAccess timed out` as well, which is the earliest signal —
40 seconds ahead of the netlink error and a full minute ahead of anything a user
would notice.

#### Second capture, and two refinements

It wedged again **17 minutes after a clean boot** — the interval is shortening
(~28 min, ~50 min, ~17 min), which matches what was seen before the factory
reset. All **10** firmware timeouts were on `phy0`; `phy1` recorded none and
still went unreachable with it, reproducing the global-blocking result exactly.

Two things the second capture corrected:

- **A single D-state sample proves nothing.** The watchdog fired on
  `hostapd_D=1` while the device went on to serve traffic for another two
  minutes — the daemon distributed neighbour lists successfully 14 seconds
  later. `D` is a normal momentary state for any process in a blocking syscall.
  It now requires D across five samples in five seconds; a wedged hostapd never
  leaves it.
- **A firmware timeout is not instantly fatal.** Two `MEMAddrAccess` timeouts
  fired and the radio kept working. By ten, both radios were blocked. So the
  useful signal is a *rate*, not a first occurrence — worth knowing for anything
  that tries to detect this generally.

#### Corrected by the driver source: MEMAddrAccess is the detector, not the cause

A research pass over the mwlwifi source (not the bug tracker — the code) makes
one thing in this section wrong.

`cmd 0x801d=MEMAddrAccess timed out` **is the driver's own heartbeat probe
failing.** `mwl_heartbeat_handle()` calls `mwl_fwcmd_get_addr_value()`, which
issues `HOSTCMD_CMD_MEM_ADDR_ACCESS` (`0x001d`), and the wait is on the response
`0x8000|cmd` = `0x801d`. So a repeating `0x801d` at a fixed interval is the
watchdog **confirming the firmware is already dead**, not the thing that killed
it. Two consequences: it is still the most reliable confirmation, and its
*absence proves nothing*, because the heartbeat only runs when `priv->heartbeat`
is non-zero.

#### And a correction to §5z: the key error was not noise

§5z recorded the two errors mwlwifi logs during an FT association as benign,
because the client went on to move 539 KB in 93 seconds. The traffic
measurement was right. **The conclusion drawn from it was wrong.**

Both wedges were preceded by a key-install failure, on the same client, at an
802.11r association:

| | key-install failure | first heartbeat timeout | gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| wedge 1 | 21:57:48 | 22:08:21 | 10.5 min |
| wedge 2 | 01:04:41 | 01:06:06 | **85 s** |

Then, once the radio was already gone, the encryption command itself started
timing out — `cmd 0x9122=UpdateEncryption timed out`, `failed to remove key (0,
<client-mac>) from hardware (-5)`, `cmd 0x9111=SetNewStation timed out`.
Four independent bug reports on the mwlwifi and OpenWrt trackers describe the
same ordering.

Two for two, on the same client, in the same code path, is correlation and not
proof. But it is the **only signal that arrives while the radio still works**,
and it is now what the watchdog leads with.

It also settles §0's original trigger claim in the other direction. The
`deauthenticated due to inactivity` line does appear in wedge 2 — at 01:11:13,
**five minutes after the radio was already dead**. It was a consequence the
whole time.

#### A hypothesis this makes testable, and worth testing

The failing path is key installation during an 802.11r association, and
oonfeeWRT enabled **both** 802.11r and PMF on this hardware — with `ieee80211w=1`
rendered onto a board whose own OpenWrt page says not to enable 802.11w at all.
That does not make the config the cause. It does mean the obvious experiment has
never been run: **turn PMF off on this device and see whether it survives longer
than 50 minutes.** Nothing else about the deployment needs to change.

**It was run, both ways, and the hypothesis is CONFIRMED — §5am and §5an.**
PMF off: 14h50m with zero timeouts, including hours carrying a client on phy0
doing exactly the fast transitions this paragraph names as the failing path.
PMF back on, same boot, no power cycle: **the wedge returned 85 seconds after
the first forced FT roam.** The variable is isolated and the chain is observed
end to end.

#### Verified in passing: the neighbour reconciler self-heals a rebooted AP

A reboot clears runtime `rrm_nr` state, and **a device reboot is not one of the
three nudge triggers** (adopt, unadopt, apply). So the only thing that could
restore it was the periodic cycle reading `rrm_nr_list` back and noticing it was
empty — the "reconciles rather than applies" claim of §5t, which until now had
only ever been tested against an apply.

It held. The WRT came back with `0/0` neighbours and was refilled to `3/3` at the
next 15-minute cycle, **with no apply and no adoption**.

The collector's recovery held too, and its silence was misleading rather than
wrong: `fail()` logs at Warn only on the *first* consecutive failure and at Debug
after, so a device that stays unreachable produces one line and then nothing at
INFO. It had been retrying at the 10-minute capped interval for two and a half
hours, exactly as `DefaultMaxInterval` documents, and picked the device back up
within a minute of its return without a restart.

### 5ab. Known-hardware-defect warnings

**Done 2026-08-16.** oonfeeWRT rendered `ieee80211w=1` onto a WRT3200ACM for
weeks. OpenWrt's own page for that board says plainly **not** to enable 802.11w,
because mwlwifi does not support it properly and it is off by default there for
that reason. The device accepted it without complaint, and nothing anywhere
would have told the operator.

That is a failure the capability model cannot reach. The three-state model asks
the device what it can do, and a driver broken in this particular way answers
**yes** — it takes the config, reports success, and does not work. `Quirk` covers
the narrow case of one field that is present and wrong; this is wider, a property
of a driver that no probing will reveal because the device does not know it is
broken.

`internal/capability/defects.go` is a small sourced registry matched on the
radio's reported hardware string. Two rules:

- **Warn, never rewrite.** A controller that silently downgrades the security
  settings a user asked for is worse than one that says what will not work and
  why. Auto-remediation would also make the defect invisible, and an invisible
  workaround becomes folklore the moment the driver is fixed. The test asserts
  the config still renders with the operator's PMF value untouched.
- **Say how well it is known.** Every entry carries `documented` / `measured` /
  `reported` / `anecdotal` and a Source, and the UI shows both with a tooltip
  explaining each — so folklore is never shown with a maintainer's authority,
  and a warning that goes stale can be traced and deleted rather than repeated
  forever.

Warnings are split by where the operator can act: config-triggered defects at
render time (on the **rendered** values, so it catches what the renderer derives
— WPA3 forcing PMF on is exactly that), radio-state defects against the device,
and defects no configuration causes once at adoption, while someone is still
deciding whether to build on the hardware.

#### The research pass was worth more for what it killed

A fan-out over the driver source and trackers produced 90 claims; **7 of 8
non-anecdotal ones were refuted** on adversarial re-check — including one traced
to a ticket that had been fixed upstream eight years earlier ("the claimant read
the ticket, not the driver repo"). Only entries traceable to the device's own
OpenWrt page or to measurements here were shipped. `irqbalance`, the most-cited
workaround for this board, is not even installed on the reference device.

The one claim that survived is now in the entry: **mwlwifi has no firmware
recovery path.** A timed-out host command logs, sets `cmd_timeout`, returns
`-EIO`; nothing resets the chip, and firmware is re-downloaded only on PCI
probe — which is why no `wifi` restart or re-apply can recover it. Driver-wide
across 88W8864/8997/8964; the hang is what the 8964 does in the field.

And the refutation caught a piece of folklore in the *fix*: it recommended
`rmmod mwlwifi; modprobe mwlwifi`, checked STATUS.md, and found this project had
already measured that leaving `modprobe` hung with no radios at all and still
needing the reboot. The registry now warns against it. A registry whose job is
to stop people acting on folklore must not ship any.

#### Two bugs in it, found by review within the hour

- **A clean bill from a check that never ran.** `Hardware` comes from
  `iwinfo.info`, which only answers for a radio that has an **interface** — so a
  stock OpenWrt router matched nothing and got silence. Same root cause as the
  §5z adoption bug, on the same devices. `HardwareIdentified()` separates them
  and both the preview and adoption now say the check did not run.
- **A guard that could not fire.** The DFS entry read `channel` from a
  wifi-iface, which never carries one — the renderer emits no `wifi-device`
  sections at all. Defects about the radio's current state now get
  `TriggersRadio` and are evaluated against the device.

### 5ac. Foreign SSIDs: the takeover brief, and three defects in the badge

**Done 2026-08-16.** A user noticed the Archer C6 broadcasting `example-operator-2g`
and `example-operator-5g` and asked why oonfeeWRT did not manage them — "wouldn't it be
better if all SSIDs were managed?"

**The default is right, and the reason is worth stating plainly.** A section is
managed **iff** this controller wrote it and can put it back. That is what makes
un-adopt a promise rather than a hope, and what stops a bug here from eating
config a human made by hand. Widening "managed" to mean "an SSID I have opinions
about" would not manage more; it would make the word stop meaning anything.

#### The panel killed the automated import, twice

Three designs were generated and judged adversarially. **Both automated import
designs failed the same way**: each confirmed its own irreversible step with a
health check that could not see what it claimed to prove. One would have let
un-adopt **delete a network the operator had before oonfeeWRT existed**, with the
restore "confirmed" by a check that short-circuits when the render contains
nothing to look for. The other gated on a config read — which §5y already
established cannot tell you what is on the air.

So the controller prints the recipe and runs none of it. Four properties, each a
test rather than a sentence:

| property | why |
|---|---|
| no passphrase field, and no field saying whether one exists | redaction as a property of the TYPE; the test marshals the whole response and greps the bytes for the C6's real key |
| nothing but `mode='ap'` gets disable advice | a station or mesh iface may be the device's only path to the network; unknown mode refuses too |
| the recipe ends in `wifi reload` | `uci commit` writes the file and does not take a BSS off the air |
| the cost names the OTHER devices | there are no per-device WLANs, so recreating a foreign SSID starts it on every AP in the group |

The cheaper half is a recorded decision: `foreign_ssid_notes` holds a note
**about** a section and never a copy of one — nothing to leak, and nothing that
could later be restored over whatever the operator has since done to their device.

#### Three defects in the badge that shipped an hour earlier

Found by review before a user hit them, and all three are §6 entries:

1. **It answered the wrong question.** `managedSSIDs` compared the SSID *string*
   against the site model, so creating a WLAN named `example-operator-5g` would flip the
   still-foreign, still-broadcasting BSS to "managed" and withdraw its warning —
   while the controller still did not own the section. My own comment called it
   "the honest approximation".
2. **Two sources joined by a string** — the unmanaged set came from the REST
   detail and was rendered over the live stats list. The §6 practice written that
   morning, broken the same afternoon.
3. **The explanation lived in a `title` tooltip.**

Provenance is now keyed on the **UCI section**, three states. `ProvUnknown`
covers a device whose ACL refuses `getWirelessDevices`: calling an operator's own
SSID foreign for want of asking is the worse error. The test that matters carries
a foreign section whose SSID is *identical* to a managed one.

#### Verified in a browser, on the lab hardware

The whole chain, seen rather than asserted: the C6 reports `section` and
`mode='ap'` for all four interfaces; the panel marks both `default_radio*`
unmanaged, names the section, and offers the recipe including the fan-out warning
*"ap-192-168-1-1 would start broadcasting it too"*; the note round-tripped to the
database attributed to `admin` and cleared cleanly.

**And opening a device populated the Clients grid for the first time.** Focusing
an AP produced the first `sta_rssi` series this deployment has ever held, and the
grid attributed the iPhone to `ap-192-168-1-1` at −81 dBm. Checked against
hostapd on both APs: the iPhone is indeed on the WRT. The Watch, on the C6, still
shows a dash — correct, because no focused poll has covered it yet.

### 5ad. The browser pass that closed §5 item 4

**Done 2026-08-16.** Four defects, none reachable by any test in the repo. The
count is now **twenty-three found by looking**.

- **The 802.11k card showed nothing until you made it happen.** It renders the
  last distribution only after somebody presses "Distribute now" — on a feature
  whose own text in that same card says it runs every fifteen minutes. So on
  arrival an operator could not tell whether 802.11k was working, and the only
  way to find out was to trigger it, which is not an observation. Every
  automatic cycle that had run all day left no trace anywhere a user looks. The
  daemon now remembers its last cycle and `GET /roaming/neighbours` reports it
  **without running one** — the test asserts that reading does not trigger.
- **The event log never said which device an event was about.** Every device
  event carries a `device_id`, the API has always returned it, the UI type has
  always declared it, and the grid had no column for it. Not hidden behind
  Customize columns: absent. `device.unreachable` told you something was
  unreachable and not what.
- **A whole serialised array in one table cell.** The Detail summariser
  `JSON.stringify`d anything object-shaped, so a `config.apply` event put its
  omissions — each a full sentence of prose — into a single cell, which ran off
  the screen and forced a horizontal scrollbar. Lists are counted now:
  `omissions=2 items` says there is something to look at without pretending the
  cell can hold it, and the count can never quietly drop the fact that more
  exists.
- **Two networks rendered as one token.** The discovery plan separated CIDRs
  with a CSS margin, so the DOM said `192.0.2.0/24203.0.113.0/24` — a gap made
  only of CSS disappears in copied text and in a screen reader.

The wireless-uplink card, the per-device override card and the adopt form all
read correctly. The discovery card's "2 things not scanned" disclosure — tunnel
interfaces and IPv6 — is exactly the kind of honesty this project is for.

### 5ae. The adversarial review of a day's work

**Done 2026-08-17.** A day that produced ~4,700 lines had been reviewed only by
the person who wrote it. Four dimensions reviewed the diff independently, then
every non-anecdotal finding faced a refuter told to default to "refuted".

**30 candidates, 6 survived.** A 20% survival rate is roughly what a review that
is not merely agreeing with itself should produce. **Four of the six were bugs
introduced that same day.**

#### The one that mattered most was not a bug

`TestTheTakeoverBriefNeverCarriesThePassphrase` hardcoded the lab C6's **actual
pre-shared key**, read off the device with `uci get`, with a comment saying so.
It went into a **public** repository — in the test whose entire subject is that
passphrases do not leak, and against a rule this project had already written
down. Removing it from the tree does not unpublish it; the key has to be rotated
on the device. Nothing about the test needed a real secret.

#### The two high-severity findings

**A URI-parsed database path.** The pragma fix earlier that day prefixed the path
with `file:`, which makes SQLite parse it as a URI rather than a filename.
Measured, one directory per case:

| path | plain | with `file:` |
|---|---|---|
| `/tmp/x` | opens x | opens x |
| `/tmp/has#hash` | opens it | **opens a different file, no error** |
| `/tmp/pct%20name` | opens it | `unable to open database file (14)` |

The `#` row is silent: a data directory containing one would bring the controller
up on a fresh empty database, migrate the whole schema into it, and report zero
devices while the real database sat beside it untouched.

**A BSS cache that could never go empty.** It was written only when the AP list
was non-empty — a proxy for "this poll asked", and wrong in both directions. A
device broadcasting nothing could never record having been looked at, so the API
answered "no poll has looked" about a device polled hundreds of times; and a
removed SSID stayed reported as on the air indefinitely, including the one the
takeover brief had just told an operator to remove. `Snapshot.APsFresh` follows
`IfacesFresh` and `NetDevsFresh` — the same rule this package had already written
down twice.

#### The trap in an obvious fix

A driver defect matched on one radio was applied to every radio: on mixed silicon
a WLAN on an Atheros radio was accused of Marvell defects, and the DFS warning
fired for a 2.4 GHz Marvell radio that cannot be on a DFS channel at any value.

**The obvious per-radio filter silences a real warning.** A homogeneous Marvell
board whose second radio has no interface reports `Hardware ""` — the §5ab case —
and filtering it out is the cardinal error by the same road. `MayAffect` excludes
only a radio *known* to be a different chip. Warning about the wrong chip is
noise; going silent about the right one is not.

Also fixed: a BSS the detail response did not mention rendered identically to one
we manage, and a channel-keyed defect judging a snapshot frozen at adoption while
the check beside it read live config.

#### The PMF experiment, five hours in

`ieee80211w=0` on both radios since 2026-08-16 21:00. The WRT has now run
**5h23m** against previous runs of **17, 28 and 50 minutes** — with **zero**
firmware heartbeat timeouts, where it previously accumulated hundreds within the
hour.

Stated as what it is: suggestive, not proven. The interval was never fixed, and
this run also began with a power cycle rather than a sysrq reset, so the
configuration is not the only thing that changed. What it does refute is my own
early-warning claim — **three key-install failures have now occurred with no
wedge following**, so that signature is a frequent event that sometimes precedes
a wedge, not a predictor.

**Superseded by §5am.** The same run reached 14h25m, and the "no client, so
inconclusive" caveat recorded here and below turned out to be false: a client
was on **phy0** from 21 minutes after boot for 2h42m, doing 802.11r fast
transitions, producing three more key-install failures — six now, still no
wedge.

### 5af. Reviewing the fixes, and what un-adopt was missing

**Done 2026-08-17.** The fixes from §5ae had been written quickly, to close
findings, and nobody had reviewed them. So they got the same treatment — four
dimensions, then a refuter on **every** candidate rather than the first fourteen,
because §5ae's own run had capped verification silently and that is the rule it
was written to catch.

**19 candidates, 19 verified, 13 confirmed.** The second round found more than
the first.

#### The worst finding was a fix that committed the error it was fixing

`APsFresh` was set from `len(ifaces) > 0` **before the batch ran** — from the
intent to ask, not from an answer. A device whose hostapd calls were all refused
then reported `broadcast_known: true` with an empty list: a positive claim that
nothing is on the air, from a check that never answered.

Measured rather than argued: the same input gives `known=true` on the fixed
version and `known=false` on the code it replaced. **That case was made strictly
worse by the fix for a different one.** It is now computed from the answers.

#### Six tests of mine asserted nothing

All six were caught by mutation testing, none by reading:

- the `APsFresh` producer had **no test at all** — hardcoding the line to either
  constant left the whole suite green
- the provenance test rendered zero rows, because the live channel was mocked to
  a no-op
- the PMF clamp test used a fixture value already valid for every mode
- the DFS "other direction" used a snapshot channel already non-DFS, so it held
  under any implementation including one ignoring the live channel entirely
- the `Enhanced open` PMF exclusion had no coverage
- the seed clamp had none either

#### Un-adopt had less ceremony than the operation it undoes

Found by opening the last screen nobody had looked at:

| | apply | un-adopt |
|---|---|---|
| rollback armed | yes | **no** |
| confirmation | "I understand" | **none** |
| shows what it touches | full preview | **a count, afterwards** |
| destructive button | secondary | **primary** |

All four are now aligned the other way. And **listing the sections immediately
found a bug in the data behind the list**: the C6 claimed a mesh section and an
uplink section that had not existed on that device for months. The apply prunes,
but `RecordOwned` only upserted, so every pruned section left its claim behind
and `owned_sections` grew monotonically. `ReplaceOwned` makes the record exactly
the rendered set.

That one is worth remembering as a method: **a count could not have surfaced it.**
Showing the individual items is what made the data wrong in a visible way.

### 5ag. The core-package review

**Done 2026-08-17.** `applyengine`, `adoption`, `ubus`, `secrets` and `store`
had never had a review pass; the two earlier rounds covered recent diffs only.
**22 candidates, all 22 verified, 6 confirmed** — four of them high, in the code
that writes to live routers.

#### The apply engine reported clean reverts as stranded, two different ways

Both spend the engine's one alarming signal on a non-event, which is worse than
noise: a genuinely stranded change then looks like all the others.

1. **`planStillApplied` matched on a key that could never differ.** It returned
   "still applied" on the first planned option that read back equal, and render
   emits an `OpSet` carrying the WHOLE section — including the ownership tag,
   which a section we already own necessarily still has after a perfect revert.
   So **every apply after the first to an owned section** that reverted cleanly
   was reported `Unknown` + `Stranded`, with an error-severity audit event
   telling the operator to hand-reverse correct config. Only options that can
   *distinguish* the two states are consulted now, snapshotted before staging.
2. **The confirm-failure path never reached verification.** Both waits were
   anchored at "now" rather than at the moment `uci.apply` armed the device's
   timer — 90s + 105s against a 180s deadline — so the context expired inside
   the wait. Anchored at the arm time, waiting only what remains.

The existing tests could not catch the first: their plans carry one key, so
nothing was ever unchanged. The new one uses the shape render actually produces.

#### `internal/adoption/ssh.go` had no tests at all

The code that writes the ACL, creates the controller's login and removes them
was exercised only through a fake. Two real bugs in it:

- **`DialSSH`'s handshake had no deadline and ignored ctx.**
  `ClientConfig.Timeout` is read only by `ssh.Dial`. A host that accepts TCP and
  never speaks SSH held adoption open forever, past the adopt timeout and past
  the cancelled request. Bounded now — and *cleared* afterwards, which is the
  load-bearing half: the same connection carries every later write.
- **`RemoveFootprint` reported success from `rm -f`.** Three statements joined
  by `;`, so the verdict was the last one's, and `rm -f` succeeds on a file that
  was never there. Anything that made uci fail while unlink worked reported a
  clean un-adopt, leaving the login to return at the next reboot. It reads both
  halves back now.

#### And a batch that ran on the device with its answers discarded

`ubus`'s re-login retry discarded `buildChunk`'s end index. A fresh session's ids
can be wider, so across a power-of-ten boundary the rebuild holds one call fewer
— and it was posted anyway. The device ran N-1 calls, the length check rejected
the reply, and the original results were returned: **the writes landed while
every call was reported denied**, with `Retried` false, which makes
`IsPermanent` report a permanent ACL gap as transient.

#### The SSH host-key pin — fixed in §5ah

The sixth finding: `internal/adoption/ssh.go` captured the fingerprint at
adoption and threw it away, so the host-key-change refusal could not fire on
any device. Closed 2026-08-17; the write-up moved to §5ah.

---

### 5ah. A guard that was written, reviewed, shipped — and unreachable

**Done 2026-08-17.** The last open finding from §5ag, and the most instructive
one in the set, because nothing about it looked wrong.

`DialSSH` refuses a device whose SSH host key has changed. The refusal is
correct, its error text is good, and it **could not run**. Both call sites left
`SSHOptions.HostKeyFP` empty, `adoption.Result.HostKeyFP` was dropped when the
`store.Device` was built, there was no column to hold it, and no test touched
the branch. Five separate places, each of which reads as an omission only once
you know about the other four — which is why a review that reads a file at a
time will not find this class at all. **It took following one value end to end.**

It matters at **un-adopt** rather than adoption. Adoption is genuinely first
use: there is nothing to check against, and refusing to adopt until an operator
has collected fingerprints by hand is a worse answer. Un-adopt dials the
**stored** address carrying the administrator password the operator has just
typed into the panel.

What landed:

- **Migration 9** adds `devices.host_key_fp`, NULL for everything adopted
  before it. That is the honest value — nobody recorded a key for those devices,
  and back-filling one would pin whatever answers next, which is precisely what
  a pin exists to catch. Un-adopt learns the key on its first dial, so the
  second attempt is checked even though the first could not be.
- **`UpsertDevice` COALESCEs on the stored value**, not the incoming one, so
  neither a caller that omits the field nor one carrying a different key can
  blank or quietly re-pin it. `cert_fp` deliberately keeps the older
  take-the-new-value rule: a certificate is re-derived on every https connection
  and rotates legitimately, whereas a host key changing means the box was
  reflashed.
- **`SetHostKeyFP` is first-use-only and refuses an empty fingerprint.** The
  caller reads it from a `Bootstrap`, and a fake — or a bootstrap that never
  handshook — returns `""`. Storing that would leave the column looking
  unpinned while having been "set", so the first-use branch would never run
  again: a non-guard that reports itself as configured.
- **Force survives a refused dial.** This is created by the fix rather than
  found by it. Reflashing is the commonest reason a host key changes, and a
  reflash also wipes the footprint un-adopt came to remove — so without an
  escape, adding the pin would make a reflashed device permanently un-removable
  from the inventory, failing at the dial before Force was ever consulted. The
  residue is still reported honestly: with no SSH session, phase 2 never runs
  and the report says the login and ACL remain.
- **`AdoptResult.HostKeyFP` is filled in.** Declared since adoption was written,
  never set. A fingerprint nobody is shown is one nobody can compare against
  `ssh-keygen -lf`, and adoption is the single moment both ends are known to be
  the same box.

**The two lab APs are still unpinned, and will be until they are re-adopted.**
Worth saying plainly rather than leaving implied by the migration note: they
were adopted before the column existed, `host_key_fp` is NULL for both, and the
only code path that can learn a key is un-adopt — which is too late to protect
that same dial. There is no other SSH path (re-probe is ubus), so nothing pins
them in the background. A deliberate hold, not an oversight: the alternative is
a separate "pin now" action that asks for an SSH credential, which is a feature
for a fleet, not for two devices that can be re-adopted in a minute.

**The tests use a real in-process SSH server**, generated key and all, because
the guard lives inside the handshake and no fake reaches it. Two servers in one
test is what lets "a different box is answering at this address" be expressed at
all. Five mutations, five failures: unwiring the pin, taking the new value in
the upsert, dropping the TOFU clause, dropping the empty-key guard, and removing
the Force escape. The migration was run against a copy of the live database —
both devices read back unpinned, which is the documented legacy state rather
than a bug.

### 5ai. The screen above the change — un-adopt had no way out

**Done 2026-08-17.** §5ah gave un-adopt a new way to fail, so the next thing to
read was the panel sitting on top of it. Two defects, neither reachable by any
test that existed, and the first is the worst thing found in a screen so far.

#### A device that cannot be reached could never leave the inventory

`force` has been on `UnadoptRequest` since un-adopt was written. `api.unadopt`
in the client has always accepted it. **No screen ever sent it.** So dead
hardware, a reflashed box, a lost administrator password — and, as of §5ah, a
refused host key — left a row that could not be removed at all: listed, polled,
counted, forever, with a hand-written API call as the only escape.

This is §5ah's shape one layer up, and worth noticing as a pattern rather than
an incident: **a capability declared at every layer but the last one is
indistinguishable from a capability that was never built**, and it reads as
complete from every angle except actually using it. The Go side had a field, a
JSON tag, a documented meaning and a comment explaining the ordering that made
it work. The TypeScript side had it in the request type. Nothing called it.

The recovery is offered only *after* something fails, from both places a
failure can land — the result view when the row survives, and the form when the
request threw — and behind its own confirmation, because it is its own
decision. The one above says "revert this device"; this one says "give up on
reaching it, and lose the record of what is still installed". It carries the
credential when the failed attempt had one, since the daemon still tries phase 2
and only skips it when the connection fails.

#### And the report was rendered and discarded in the same tick

`onDone()` ran the moment the request returned, and it unmounts the whole
slide-over. So the residue list — the last copy of what is still installed on a
device whose inventory row has just been deleted — was painted and thrown away
before anything could read it. `Close` does it now, and only when the row is
really gone.

Harmless until today, which is why it survived: a removal could only happen when
it was *clean*, so the discarded list was always empty. Making forced removal
reachable is what turns that list into the only copy. **A latent defect and its
activating change arrived in the same afternoon, from opposite ends.**

#### Then driving it found two more

Reading the panel found the first two. **Running** it found two more, which is
the distinction worth keeping: a screen can be correct in every state you
imagined and wrong in the state the flow actually reaches.

The flow was exercised against a **throwaway inventory row pointing at a closed
port** — not the lab APs. A wrong password against a real device is not a safe
way to produce this failure: the reference hardware accepts *any* password when
root has none (§0), so the "failed" attempt would have succeeded and genuinely
un-adopted a working AP. A dead address fails at `DialSSH`, which happens
*before* `Adopter.Unadopt`, so phase 1 never runs and nothing is written
anywhere.

- **The residue hint said "supply the credential and try again."** True while a
  row survives; nonsense after a forced removal, which is the case where that
  list is the *only* record of what is still installed. It now says to copy the
  list before closing, and offers the retry only while there is something to
  retry against.
- **The "Revert config only" note had drifted two cards away** from the button
  it explains, below the forced-removal card.

End to end against the running daemon: row removed, report still on screen with
both residue entries, audit event recording `forced=true
footprint_remains=true`, no orphaned `owned_sections`, and the fleet count
refreshing only on Close.

---

### 5aj. Reviewing the afternoon's own fixes — four more, three self-inflicted

**Done 2026-08-17.** §5af's rule again, and it held again: the round that
reviews the fixes found more than the round that found the bugs.

#### A failed un-adopt threw away the report that failure produced

`writeErr` sends `{"error": "..."}` and nothing else, and the handler used it for
every error. But `Unadopt` returns a result **and** an error together in two real
cases: a phase-2 failure with the credential supplied, and a **forced** removal
whose phase 2 connected and then could not commit — a full `/overlay`, a held
uci lock, exactly the states §5ag's `RemoveFootprint` verification exists to
catch.

In that second case **the inventory row is already gone** and `Residue` is the
only surviving record of what is installed on that device. The bare error string
destroyed the one thing nobody could recover, and there was no row left to ask
about. This is the §5ai defect again, by a different route — and reaching it
required making forced removal reachable, which was mine, three commits earlier.
**A fix that opens a path is responsible for what is already on it.**

- `UnadoptResult` gained `error`, named to match what every other endpoint puts
  in an error body, so a generic client still finds a message where it looks for
  one. The report now travels with the 502; with no report, a plain error still
  goes, because an empty report renders as "nothing removed, nothing remains".
- The panel accepted a body only on 409. It takes any report-shaped body now,
  keyed on `removed_from_inventory` — the one field the Go type always emits.
  **Keying it on an omittable field passed the first two tests**; a third case (a
  report with no residue: phase 1 failed on one section, phase 2 cleaned up, row
  removed) is what distinguishes them, and it exists because the mutation found
  the gap rather than the reading.
- **"Still in the inventory" and "needs the administrator credential" were one
  banner.** A phase-2 failure with a credential supplied was described as
  needing one, sending the operator to re-type a password already correct.

#### And the forced-removal confirmation was sticky

Tick it, think better of it, retry with a corrected password, fail again — and
the destructive action is one click away, un-reconfirmed, at exactly the point
the speed bump exists for. Every attempt re-earns it now. The ordinary
confirmation deliberately does **not** reset: that one is consent to un-adopt
this device, which retrying the same operation does not withdraw.

#### A third round, and the fix's own fix

Reviewing §5aj found one more, again mine, again from the commit before.

**Moving `onDone` to Close made the slide-over's `×` a silent second exit.**
`onDone` both refreshes the fleet and closes; firing it the instant the request
returned is what threw the report away, so it moved to Close — which left the
`×` as a way out that refreshes nothing. A removed device stayed in the table:
**a controller listing a router it had just deleted.** The `×` lives outside the
component and cannot be intercepted, so the unmount catches it, guarded by a
flag that Close clears so the refresh does not happen twice.

The flag is set in **one** place, because a report arrives on both paths and the
worst case arrives on the failure one — a forced removal whose phase 2 could not
commit returns 502 with `removed_from_inventory` already true. Setting it beside
only the success path would leave precisely that case listing a deleted router.

And one of the three tests written for it **was itself a no-op**, caught by
mutation rather than by reading: the "refreshes once, not twice" spy only
recorded, so the component stayed mounted, the cleanup never ran, and the
assertion held whether or not the flag was cleared. A spy standing in for a
callback whose *effect* is what the test depends on has to have that effect —
`onDone` now tears the panel down the way `setOpenID(null)` does.

**Three rounds on one panel: 2, then 3, then 1.** The tail is real but it is
thinning, which is the first time that has been true of a review sequence here.

#### Verified against a device that answers and can do nothing

`tools/hostilessh` was written for this and kept: it accepts any password and
fails every command with the stderr uci gives on a read-only overlay. Pointing a
throwaway inventory row at it produces the half-succeeded state — phase 2 runs,
nothing can be removed, `Unadopt` returns a result *and* an error — which is the
hardest case to reach and the one that was silently discarding its own report.

Driven in the browser, it now renders: the new banner (still in the inventory,
**not** claiming a missing credential, since one was supplied), the residue list
on an error path, and the device's own `uci: Cannot write to file: Read-only file
system`. It also exercised **§5ag's `RemoveFootprint` verification against a
hostile device for the first time** — it refused to report a clean un-adopt when
`rm -f` would have succeeded and uci did not, which is precisely what it was
written for and had only ever been checked by a unit test.

---

### 5ak. The panel charted the one series that is usually empty — and three chart defects behind it

**Done 2026-08-17.** Started from a contradiction visible on one screen: the
Broadcasting card read **"channel 1 is 74.1% busy"**, live, directly above a
**"Channel utilization"** chart reading **"No data yet"**. Same radio, same
panel, same second.

They are two different sources, and the panel had charted the wrong one.

| | source | tier | rollup buckets |
|---|---|---|---|
| the live card | `ap_airtime_pct` — hostapd BSS load | **baseline, every poll** | 189 |
| the chart | `chan_busy_pct` — `iwinfo.survey` | **focused only** | 31, newest an hour old |

`Surveys []Survey // focused only`. So channel utilization was recorded while
somebody had the panel open and not otherwise — and **the chart's empty message
told the operator to wait**, which means closing the panel, which is the one
thing that guarantees it stays empty.

**Confirmed rather than reasoned.** Opening the panel and watching produced a new
`chan_busy` bucket at 07:45 after an hour of nothing. One observation, whole
diagnosis.

What landed:

- **Both are charted**, because they are two measurements and neither
  substitutes for the other. Measured over paired buckets on both devices: the
  means agree to within **1.6 points**, single buckets diverge by up to **16** on
  a busy 2.4 GHz radio. BSS load leads — it has the continuous line, and it is
  what hostapd advertises in its beacons, so it is the number clients act on when
  deciding whether to roam. Recording the comparison here so nobody later
  "simplifies" by deleting one on the assumption they are the same.
- **The survey chart says why it is empty**, in its own words rather than the
  shared ones.
- **One chart per RADIO, not per BSS.** Both quantities belong to the radio and
  both sources report them per interface, so a radio carrying two SSIDs produced
  two identical series — the Archer C6 drew **four** utilization charts, two
  pairs of duplicates agreeing to the decimal, all four empty. Two populated and
  two explained now.

The source note went in the title row first and **wrapped mid-phrase into the
1h/1D/1W buttons** — a flex row with `space-between`, which a sentence squeezes.
A screenshot showed that; the tests could not, and would not have.

#### Then the newly-visible chart showed two more

Making the survey series render is what exposed them. Both are chart defects
that had always been there and had nothing to look at.

**An axis whose every tick read "63%".** `fmt.percent` chose decimals from the
VALUE's magnitude — one below 10, none above — which is the wrong input. An
axis spanning 0.6 points wants a decimal whether it sits at 63 or at 6, so a
sparse survey chart rendered two labels reading `63%` at different heights with
a line sloping between them. A reader cannot tell that from a broken axis.
Precision now comes from the spacing between ticks; the magnitude rule stays as
the fallback for a tooltip or a table cell, where one reading stands alone.

**And then a flat series drawn as a dramatic climb.** Fixing the labels revealed
why they needed fixing: the axis then read `i3.030%` / `i3.020%` — three-decimal
labels clipped by a 58px gutter. uPlot fits the axis to the data, so a series
that barely moves is magnified until its rounding noise fills the chart. Channel
occupancy between **63.020% and 63.030%** — flat by any measure — was drawn as a
confident climb across the panel. **This is the noise-floor rule again**, which
this same file already states: a smooth, stable, meaningless line is the most
convincing kind of wrong. Percent charts now take a one-point floor on the
y-range, centred on the data and clamped at zero.

The testing lesson is sharper than either fix. `fmt.percent` passed its own
tests the whole time **while the chart called it with no step at all** — a
correct function, wired to nothing. The mutation that swapped the axis callback
back to `vals.map(v => format(v))` broke no test, so the composition was pulled
out as `axisLabels()` and tested directly. What is STILL uncovered is written in
the comment rather than implied: the one call site inside the uPlot options
needs a real canvas to reach, so inlining the map there again would restore the
bug silently.

---

### 5al. "Focused polls" was a count of devices

**Done 2026-08-17.** Noticed in passing: the dashboard stat read **0** while a
device panel two clicks away reported `focused`, a 10s interval, and a poll
count climbing.

**The zero was right; the label was not.** `focused_devices` counts DEVICES in
the focused tier, and it sat under a label promising a count of polls — on the
one screen whose own sibling comment states the rule, that showing one number
under another's label is how a dashboard gets quietly distrusted.

Zero is also the *normal* reading rather than a broken one: focus is held by an
open device panel, so anybody looking at the dashboard has released it. The
stat says so now, under the number and in the note below, because a
permanently-zero counter with no explanation reads as a stuck one.

The Dashboard **had no tests at all**; it has three. The count assertion uses 7
rather than 2 — the fleet numbers on that screen are 2s and 5s, and an assertion
that passes by matching a different stat's value is not an assertion about this
one. That was caught by the test failing on a collision, which is the cheap
version of the same lesson §6 keeps recording.

---

### 5am. The WRT has carried a client, and did not wedge

**Measured 2026-08-17 09:20.** The PMF-off experiment was recorded as
inconclusive on the grounds that the device "has carried zero clients the entire
time". **That was wrong**, and the way it was wrong is worth more than the
result: it came from reading a live `get_clients`, which showed an empty list
*at that moment*, and treating it as a statement about the whole run. **A
current reading is not a history.** The history was in the station telemetry the
controller had been writing all along, and in the device's own log.

What the two sources actually say, in the device's own clock (UTC, seven hours
ahead of the controller's — an easy way to mis-align these):

| | |
|---|---|
| uptime at check | **14h25m** (booted 01:52 UTC / 18:52 PDT) |
| `MEMAddrAccess timed out` | **0** |
| `nl_recvmsgs failed` (the downstream marker) | **0** |
| client associated | **+21 min after boot**, for **2h42m** |
| which radio | **phy0** — the 5 GHz one whose firmware hangs |
| associations / disconnects | 3 / 3, all `auth_alg=ft` (802.11r fast transition) |
| **key-install failures** | **3** |
| `ieee80211w` in the live hostapd conf | **0**, both radios |

So the precursor fired. **Key-install failures, on a real client, doing fast
transitions, on the exact radio that fails — and no wedge followed.** The three
earlier wedges came at 17, 28 and 50 minutes after boot; this run had a client
on phy0 from minute 21 and has now run more than fourteen hours.

That also settles the early-warning question the memory had already doubted:
`key addition failed` is a **frequent event that sometimes precedes a wedge**,
not a predictor.

**Correction — `logread` counts are windowed, not cumulative.** The table above
first carried exact tallies (3 key failures, 3 associations, 6 across runs).
They are not sound: `logread` reads a **128 KB ring buffer that rotates**, and
on this device its oldest surviving line was already 22 minutes *after* boot.
The counts drop as the window slides, which is how it was noticed at all — a
watchdog reported `key` going from 4 to 3, and a cumulative counter cannot go
down. Treat every number derived from `grep -c` on `logread` as "in the last so
many lines".

**The conclusion survives, on better evidence than the counts.** The wedge is
*persistent* — recovery needs a power cycle (§5aa) — so a device that is
answering ubus, carrying clients and completing associations **is not wedged and
has not been at any point in this boot**, whatever the log retains. That
argument covers the 22-minute blind spot the buffer does not, and the blind spot
matters, because the earliest recorded wedge was at 17 minutes.

**Still not proof, and the reasons are specific rather than ritual.** One client
and one run. The run began with a power cycle *and* `ieee80211w=0` together, so
the two variables have never been separated — the honest next experiment is to
put PMF back on with a client present and see whether it returns. And three
associations is little churn; the earlier failures may have needed more.

---

### 5an. The PMF-ON experiment — the one that separates the variables

**Run 2026-08-17 09:30.** §5am left one thing unseparated: the clean 14-hour run
began with a power cycle **and** `ieee80211w=0` together, so neither had been
ruled out. This is the experiment that distinguishes them — put PMF back on,
with a client, on the same boot, and see whether the wedge returns. **No power
cycle**, so the boot is held constant and PMF is the only thing that moves.

Set through the controller rather than by hand, which also exercised the apply
path: PMF → **Optional** (`ieee80211w=1`, the exact value present during both
original wedges), applied to both APs, verified in the **running**
`/var/run/hostapd-phy*.conf` and in uci. The defect registry did its job on the
way through, warning that mwlwifi accepts `ieee80211w` and does not implement it
— which is the whole reason this is worth measuring.

Conditions, all confirmed rather than assumed:

- client `36:e0:…:fb` on **phy0-ap0, 5180 MHz** — the radio whose firmware hangs
- **`"mfp": true`** in `get_clients` — PMF *negotiated*, not merely configured
- 802.11r still on (`FT-PSK`, `ft_over_ds=1`), unchanged from the wedging config
- boot held constant: the same uptime that reached 14h45m clean under PMF-off

#### Deauthing does not reproduce it. Steering does.

Worth recording because it cost a first attempt. Both original wedges followed a
key-install failure during an **802.11r** association, so the obvious way to
force the path is to knock the client off and let it come back —
`del_client` with `deauth`, repeatedly.

**That produces the wrong kind of association.** A deauthed client does a full
reauthentication and reconnects with `auth_alg=open`; it has no cached keys to
fast-transition with. Every historical `key addition failed` line in this
device's log sits immediately before an `auth_alg=**ft**` connect, and never
before an `open` one. Eight forced deauths produced eight `open` associations
and not one key failure.

FT happens when a client **roams between APs** in one mobility domain. So the
lever is 802.11v BSS transition management — `bss_transition_request` on the AP
the client is currently on, naming the other AP's neighbour report — which asks
it to move, and it moves using FT because that is what FT is for.

One steer reproduced it immediately:

```
16:41:11 nl80211: kernel reports: key addition failed
16:41:11 AP-STA-CONNECTED <client-mac> auth_alg=ft
```

That is the precondition, on phy0, with `mfp` negotiated. The run then
ping-pongs both clients between the two APs — 15 cycles, ~50s each — so every
cycle lands at least one FT association on the failing radio.

**A convenient accident made this possible at all:** the earlier deauth pushed
one client onto the C6 while a second joined the WRT, leaving one client on each
AP. Two clients in one mobility domain is what makes steering a roam rather than
a disconnection.

A watchdog polls the device every 60s for `MEMAddrAccess`, `nl_recvmsgs failed`,
key-install failures, associations and disconnects, and reports only changes.

#### Result: PMF is the trigger. The wedge returned in 85 seconds.

**One forced roam was enough.** Not the fifteen cycles planned — the first.

```
16:41:11  nl80211: kernel reports: key addition failed
16:41:11  AP-STA-CONNECTED 36:e0:…:fb auth_alg=ft      ← the roam I steered
16:42:36  ieee80211 phy0: cmd 0x801d=MEMAddrAccess timed out    ← +85s
16:42:56  …timed out
16:43:16  …timed out            ← and now the downstream failure, +40s exactly
16:43:16  nl80211: nl80211_recv_beacons->nl_recvmsgs failed: -5
16:44:48  …timed out, every ~20s thereafter
```

**The controls are what make this conclusive.** Same device, same boot, no power
cycle — the variable §5am could not separate is held fixed here. That same boot
had already run **14h50m carrying clients on the same radio with PMF off**. The
only thing that changed was `ieee80211w`, and the failure came back inside two
minutes of the first fast transition.

It also **confirms §5aa's causal ordering to the second**: the first
`MEMAddrAccess` at 16:42:36 leads the first `nl_recvmsgs failed: -5` at 16:43:16
by exactly the 40 seconds §5aa measured. The firmware dies first; netlink EIO is
the consequence. (A first look at the data suggested the reverse — an artifact
of reading `tail -1` of each pattern rather than the first of each.)

So the chain is now end to end, every link observed rather than inferred:

**PMF on → key installation fails during an 802.11r FT association → the
88W8964's firmware stops answering 85 seconds later → nl80211 serialisation
takes every radio on the box with it → power cycle.**

`key addition failed` is therefore not a *predictor* — six-ish occurrences
passed harmlessly with PMF off — but it **is** the failing step when PMF is on.
Both readings of the earlier evidence were half right.

#### It isolates further than expected: keep 802.11r

The evidence already collected answers a second question, and the answer is
useful rather than merely tidy. §5aa guessed that "disabling PMF **and** fast
transition on this hardware is worth trying". Only one of those is needed.

At **06:29**, with PMF **off**, a fast-transition roam onto phy0 logged the
identical `nl80211: kernel reports: key addition failed`. The device then ran
**another ten hours** with zero firmware timeouts. The first `MEMAddrAccess` in
the whole buffer is at 16:42:36 — after PMF went on.

| | measured? | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 802.11r FT, PMF **off** | yes | key-install failure, **no wedge**, 10h+ clean after |
| 802.11r FT, PMF **on** | yes | **wedge in 85s** |
| PMF on, 802.11r **off** | **no — and deliberately not** | unknown |

So **fast roaming is what exposes the defect, not what causes it.** An operator
told only "turn off PMF" might reasonably turn off 802.11r as well and lose
seamless handover for nothing. The mitigation now says to keep it.

**The empty cell stays empty, on purpose.** Filling it was started and stopped —
correctly. The recommendation cannot change whichever way it goes: the hardware's
own documentation says not to enable 802.11w at all, and the failure costs
somebody a trip to the device to pull its power. An experiment whose result
cannot alter the advice is not worth a radio. The mitigation says so rather than
inviting the reader to try it, which is what it did for one commit.

*A gap in a table is not automatically a task.* Noting a variable was not
isolated is honest; treating that note as a to-do is how a measured, settled
answer turns back into an open question.

**What shipped as a result.** The registry entry for
`mwlwifi-80211w-unsupported` moves from `ConfDeviceDoc` to **`ConfMeasuredHere`**
and carries the reproduction, the 85-second figure, and the keep-802.11r
guidance. Every oonfeeWRT user with Marvell hardware now gets a warning backed
by a measurement instead of a repeated wiki line — which is what that whole
registry was built for. A test pins the confidence and severity so a rewording
cannot quietly demote it to hearsay again. The prose itself is deliberately
**not** asserted on: a test that pins wording breaks on every improvement to it
and protects nothing that matters.

**Left safe.** The WRT's stored config was set back to `ieee80211w=0` over SSH —
a file write, no phy0 contact — so its next boot comes up clean; the C6 was
returned to PMF off and reloaded; the site model is back to Disabled.

#### Recovery confirmed

Power-cycled 2026-08-17 10:01. The device came back exactly as the pre-staged
config intended: `ieee80211w=0` both live and committed, **zero**
`MEMAddrAccess`, both radios `status: ENABLED` and carrying `example-managed-wlan` —
phy0-ap0 on channel 36 at 80 MHz, phy1-ap0 on channel 1. So the recovery
procedure is confirmed end to end: **write the safe config while wedged, then
pull the power.** Nothing has to be repaired afterwards.

**A tooling trap worth keeping.** The first health check ran
`timeout 5 ubus call …` on the device and printed nothing for both radios, which
reads exactly like "the radios are not answering" — a false alarm on a device
that had just come back clean. The real cause was `ash: timeout: not found`:
**busybox on this build has no `timeout`**. Any bound on a device-side call has
to come from the CLIENT — `ssh -o ConnectTimeout` and a local watchdog — because
the remote binary you are relying on to enforce it may simply not exist, and its
absence is indistinguishable from the hang you were guarding against. This is
§6's "a refused check is not a negative answer" wearing yet another hat, and it
nearly cost a wrong conclusion about the hardware in the same minute the real
one was confirmed.

---

### 5ao. The one hazard on the apply screen a rollback cannot undo

**Done 2026-08-17,** as the direct consequence of §5an. Once the Marvell PMF
defect became **measured** rather than documented, the question was whether the
controller does enough with it. It did not.

The first suspicion was wrong and worth saying so: `Apply` and `Preview` are
separate buttons, so an operator looked able to apply without ever seeing the
warning. They are not — `disabled={… || !preview || …}`, with a comment saying
it is "deliberately unreachable without previewing first". Checked before
changing anything.

**What was actually wrong is an asymmetry.** This screen already stops for
`touches_traversal` — editing the network path the controller reaches a device
through — and demands an explicit acknowledgement toggle. Its own banner
explains why that is safe: *"applied with a rollback armed, so a device that
comes back unreachable restores itself within 90 seconds."*

That is true there and **false** for a radio-death defect. A radio that stops
answering cannot be reached to confirm or revert, and on the reference hardware
it stayed down until the box was physically power-cycled. So:

| hazard | recoverable? | gated? |
|---|---|---|
| edits the controller's own path | yes — rollback, 90s | **acknowledgement required** |
| measured to kill the radio | **no — needs physical access** | *nothing* |

The lesser hazard asked for consent; the greater one asked for none. And the
reassurance printed immediately above the Apply button — every change has a
rollback armed — is the one line on the screen that is wrong about this case.

Now gated by the same pattern, with the banner saying plainly that the rollback
does not cover it. **Filtered on two things, both load-bearing:** the defect must
carry a `wlan` — meaning the configuration being applied asks for it — and be
`radio-death`. Gating on severity alone would catch the *hardware* defect that
no configuration causes and none can avoid, demanding a tick before every apply
to that device forever, which is §6's cry-wolf failure made mandatory.

#### And both acknowledgements were sticky

Found while adding the new one. `runPreview` never reset `ackTraversal`: tick
it, edit the site, preview again, and **Apply was enabled for a different set of
changes nobody had acknowledged.** Consent to one plan carried silently to the
next. The screen is careful that a stale preview never sits beside an enabled
Apply — a stale *acknowledgement* is the same defect one level down, and it is
the third time this session that a confirmation has turned out to persist past
the thing it confirmed (§5aj was the un-adopt one).

Four mutations, four failures — and two of the tests had to be fixed first. One
asserted on the transient `busy` disable rather than the acknowledgement, so it
passed with the reset removed; the other covered only the new toggle, so a
mutation that reset it and left the traversal one sticky passed everything.

### 5ap. Phase 0's second proof, finally run — and what running it cost

**Done 2026-08-17.** The proof that "decides whether the project is
trustworthy", per its own test comment, had never been executed. It now passes
on hardware:

```
before adoption:   326 config lines,  9 ACL files
applied to roundtrip: applied — health passed and confirm landed
owns 2 section(s) on the device
un-adopted: reverted=2 login_removed=true acl_removed=true remains=false
after un-adoption: 326 config lines,  9 ACL files
device is byte-for-byte as it was before adoption
```

Getting there took four failures, and each was a real finding.

**1. The test was missing its middle step.** It quoted ROADMAP's "adopt a
device, MAKE CHANGES, un-adopt it, and diff" and went straight from adopt to
un-adopt, so nothing was ever owned and `RevertedSections` was structurally 0.
It proved the narrower claim that *adoption* leaves nothing behind. It now
saves a network, a group and a WLAN, applies them, and asserts ownership exists
before removing it.

**2. The apply reported `unknown` while the change was demonstrably on the
device.** Cause: `TrackApply` gives every apply a context deadline of
`Config.ApplyDrain`, and `testConfig` sets **2 seconds** — right for the unit
tests that exercise shutdown, impossible for an operation whose device-side
rollback window is 90s plus 15s of grace.

The harness caused it; the knob deserved it. `ApplyDrain` documented itself as
bounding applies **"at shutdown"** while actually bounding *every* apply,
always, and `Validate` accepted any positive value. Tuning it down for a
snappier SIGTERM would silently cap every write to every device, and the
failure mode is the engine's one alarming outcome produced by configuration
rather than by anything a device did. The doc now leads with what it does,
`applyengine` exports `MinApplyBudget()` so a caller can derive the floor, and
`Open` warns below it — warns rather than refuses, because a tiny drain is how
the shutdown path itself gets tested.

**3. A failed run stranded its footprint**, so the next run reported "adoption
installed no ACL file" and pointed at adoption instead of at the previous
failure. Two runs were lost to that before a `t.Cleanup` was added.

**4. Re-adopting silently drops a device out of its AP groups.** Un-adopt
deletes the device row and `ap_group_members` goes with it by cascade; the
re-adopted device is a NEW id in no group. So no WLAN targets it, nothing
renders, and preview says **"already matches — nothing to do"** — true, and
useless. The device was adopted, healthy, polling, and off the air, with every
screen agreeing it was fine. Render now says so per device and names the
re-adoption case explicitly, guarded on the site having WLANs at all so a fresh
install is not told the same thing about every device.

#### Devices can be renamed

Raised while looking at the fleet list: the model-derived default — "TP-Link
Archer C6 v2 (US)" rather than "ap-192-168-1-2" — is the *right* default,
because it is what someone recognises looking at a shelf of routers. It was
already the behaviour; `ap-192-168-1-1` was never a product default at all, but
a name left behind by `neighbors_integration_test.go`, which adopts with
`Name: "ap-"+host`.

What did not exist was any way to change it — no `SetName`, no endpoint,
nothing in the UI. The name was decided once at adoption and fixed forever,
which fails the moment a site holds two of the same model. Added as a narrow
store write, an audited endpoint, and in-place editing on the device panel.
Clearing the field restores the model rather than being refused: that is
adoption's own fallback chain, so "undo my rename" needs no separate control.

And then the review of that found the limit was checked **after** the
fallbacks, against a string the caller never sent — so a device whose model ran
past 120 characters could never have its name cleared, refused for a length its
request did not have.

---

### 5aq. The collector's first review — two numbers that were quietly wrong

**Done 2026-08-17.** §5ag's core review covered `applyengine`, `adoption`,
`ubus`, `secrets` and `store`. It never touched **`collector`**, which runs
continuously against every device and produces the numbers on every screen. Both
findings sit in the same seam — the gap between *what was asked* and *what came
back* — which is this repository's signature failure and the reason that seam is
worth checking first in any package.

#### The fleet client total was wrong in both directions at once

`Snapshot.ClientCount` gated on `len(s.APs) > 0` where it meant `APsFresh`.

**Under-claiming.** A device with no AP interfaces — radios off, a switch, an AP
whose WLAN has not been applied yet — has zero wireless clients, and that is a
fact. Reported as unknown, it suppressed the dashboard's **entire fleet total**
and named the device as one that "did not report a client count", which it had:
it reported that it has none. Reachable on any adopted device between un-adopt
and the next apply, a state this session spent an hour in.

**Over-claiming, which is the dangerous half.** `decodeAPStatus` *creates* the
AP entry, so a refused call leaves no entry at all — the radio that did not
answer is simply absent, and what remains looks whole. Summing it and calling
the result known draws exactly the dip the dashboard's own message says it
refuses to draw: *"adding up the rest would show a dip that looks like clients
leaving, so no total is shown at all."* Arrived at inside the function that
message trusts.

`APsFresh` answers precisely this question and is built a few lines above. One
mutation catches both directions.

#### Closing a session threw away what it cost

The request and byte counters live on the ubus client. `fail()` banks them
before discarding a session; `closeClient()` did not — and `closeClient` is what
runs when a device's address changes under one device id, because a session
token is not portable between hosts.

Worse than a smaller number: `Overhead` derives `NonPollRequests` as
`Requests - Polls`, and polls are counted on the poller, which survives. Drop
the requests, keep the polls, and the difference goes negative and clamps to
zero — so the readout whose stated purpose is surfacing calls that escaped the
batch reports none, precisely when a session has just been thrown away. The
mutation measured it: 3 requests and 1995 bytes lost, `requests(0) < polls(2)`.
One `dropClientLocked` now knows the rule, because a *difference* between two
teardown paths is what produced it.

#### Checked and deliberately left alone

Worth recording, so the next reader does not re-derive them as findings:

- **`netAt` stamps on the attempt; `boardAt` distinguishes permanent denial.**
  An asymmetry, and the blunter one is documented with its reason — a device
  whose ACL refuses `network.interface` would otherwise re-ask forever. Closing
  that by reasoning is the thing this file forbids.
- **`baselineLocked` ignores an override shorter than the default**, which is
  the documented promise that a per-device knob cannot raise the rate.
- **`s.ap()` and `s.host()` return pointers into a growing slice.** Safe as
  used: every one is consumed inside the decoder call that took it, before any
  later append can reallocate.
- **`servesClients` treats an unknown mode as "yes"**, so a refused mode read
  cannot quietly stop counting real clients.

### 5ar. Telemetry's first review — a documented residue that was reachable

**Done 2026-08-17.** `telemetry` turns polls into every number behind every
chart, and had never had a review pass.

#### A reset reconstructed as a wrap, inventing 559 Mbit/s

A decreasing counter has two causes needing opposite handling — a 32-bit wrap or
a reset — and `rate()` separated them with a physical bound: accept the wrap
only if that traffic could have crossed a gigabit link in the elapsed time. The
file already documented the residue this leaves, **"one interval wide"**, and
treated it as acceptable.

It is not. At the 60 s baseline a gigabit link carries 7.5 GB, comfortably more
than the 4.29 GB a full wrap implies — so the bound passes **every** wrap and
rejects **no** reset. Measured on the real code: a counter falling from 100 MB
to 100 kB over 60 s emitted **69,917,788 B/s, or 559 Mbit/s of traffic that
never happened**, on a link that had never exceeded a few hundred bytes a
second.

And the resets are ours. An apply reloads wifi, which destroys and recreates the
AP interfaces and zeroes their counters; `recreated` catches it only when a poll
happened to see the interface down. **Both reference devices sit in the tens of
megabytes**, far below 2^32, so `wide` is false for both and each was one apply
away from a fabricated spike on its throughput chart.

**The first fix was wrong and the existing tests said so.** Removing the wrap
branch outright broke two of them, correctly — a wrap on a busy link is real.
They also supplied the discriminator the arithmetic lacked: a genuine wrap
starts from a counter near 2^32 and yields a *small* delta at an ordinary rate,
while a reset from far below yields a delta near the whole 32-bit range. So the
interface's own history separates them when no physical bound can.
`counterState` now remembers the largest rate it has produced, and a
reconstructed wrap implying a hundred times that is a reset instead — consulted
only once a rate exists, so the two original tests still pass and a mutation
removing that condition breaks both.

#### A comment that would have broken the guard if believed

`expireStale` said the `iface_up` pseudo-key "carries no timestamp". It never
has: `ifaceCameBack` sets `lastTS` on every observation, precisely so the entry
ages with the device that owns it.

Harmless as written, dangerous as read. That state **is** the recreation
detector — the thing that turns an interface being rebuilt into a rebase rather
than a fabricated delta, which is the failure the section above exists to fix.
Anyone tidying the code to match its comment would drop the timestamp, have
every entry deleted on every flush, and silently disable it. Corrected, and
pinned by a test that fails on exactly that edit.

#### Checked and left alone

- **`ratio()` handles the apply-reset case correctly**, and does it by accident
  of a better guard: `den <= prevDen` fires because `active_time` resets
  alongside `busy_time`. This is what `rate()` was missing.
- **`Flush` retires a series and its counter baseline together**, and `ratios`
  are reaped by `expireStale` and `forgetCounters`, so neither leaks on the
  churning key — client MAC.

### 5as. Render's first review — where the guest deleted the host's furniture

**Done 2026-08-17.** `render` decides what is actually written to a device, and
had never had a review pass. Four defects, three of them silent, and every one
of them the same seam: **something the render did not know, spent as though it
were something the render had decided.**

#### A refused capability read deleted every interface we own

`Prune` removes owned sections the render no longer produces. That is exactly
right when the absence is a *decision* — the WLAN was deleted, the device left
the AP group, the role changed to one that does not broadcast. It is
catastrophic when the absence is *ignorance*.

`capability.probeRadios` has two early returns that record **no radios and
`FeatSurvey` NotObservable**: `iwinfo.devices` denied, and `getWirelessDevices`
failing with iwinfo listing nothing to fall back on. Either one is a real stored
`CapsJSON` — the one ACL JSON file is load-bearing, so this is a device adopted
under a narrower ACL, not a hypothetical.

From there: `radiosByBand` yields an empty map, every band lookup misses,
nothing wireless renders, and `Prune` reads that as *the operator emptied this
device*. It deletes every `wifi-iface` we own — the WLANs, the mesh backhaul,
**and the wireless uplink that may be the device's only path to the network.**
The apply reports success.

This is §6's cardinal error — NotObservable collapsed into Absent — committed at
the point of **deletion** rather than the point of probing. That is why the
`capability` package's considerable care about it was not enough on its own: the
distinction was preserved all the way to the last consumer, and the last
consumer threw it away.

The render *already knew*. It emits `hardware-unidentified`, whose text says in
as many words *"this is not a clean bill of health — it means the check did not
run"*, and then produced a plan to delete on the strength of it. Worse, that
warning's stated remedy is **"Apply a WLAN and re-probe"** — and the apply was
the thing doing the deleting. The advice could never work, and on a device with
nothing owned yet no WLAN could ever be applied at all: the same chicken-and-egg
`probeRadios` fixed for the *empty* iwinfo list was still fully present for the
*refused* one.

The same shape on the wired side: a device that did not report its port layout
renders no VLAN, no addressing, no DHCP and no firewall zone — pruned too, on
the config that carries the controller's own route to the device.

`Doc` now carries the distinction it always had and discarded. **`Retain`** names
exact sections a feature gate could not decide about (mesh and uplink, where the
radio is known so the name is known); **`Blind`** names configs the render could
not see into at all. `Prune` honours both, and the report says which sections
survived only because a check did not run — silence there is a preview reading
"no changes" for a device we can no longer account for.

The operator-facing text was making the same claim in words: **"device has no
2.4 GHz radio"**, printed from a refused call. That is a statement about
hardware derived from a question nobody answered — verbatim what `probe.py` said
about DSA.

#### Two distinct networks became one on the device

`name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE` in the schema, and `safe()` then truncated every
name it produced to 11 characters. **"Guest Network A"** and **"Guest Network
B"** both became `guest_netwo`, so they rendered *one* `oowrt_net_guest_netwo`,
*one* `oowrt_dhcp_guest_netwo` and *one* `oowrt_zone_guest_netwo` between them.
UCI keeps the last. VLAN 20 got its bridge-VLAN tagged onto the ports and
nothing else — no gateway address, no leases, no firewall zone — with **no
omission, no conflict and no warning**.

11 characters is fw4's limit on a zone *name*. UCI section names have no such
limit. The cap existed to stop two zones colliding past it, and applied to
section names it produced precisely that collision. It now applies only where
fw4 reads it, and two zone names that collapse to one are refused rather than
merged.

The test that should have caught this **asserted it instead** — *"two zones must
not collide past fw4's 11-character cap"* written above a check that the cap was
applied. Its loop also read `got != want && len(got) > 11`, which fails only
when a value is both wrong *and* too long, so every wrong-but-short answer
passed.

#### Every network the product could create asked for a second zone named `lan`

A zone is identified by its name, and zones were rendered once per *network*.
Two networks sharing one produced two sections with the same name, of which the
device keeps the last — leaving the other network in **no zone at all**, which
in fw4 means every packet on it is dropped.

Not a corner case: **the default path.** `store.SaveNetwork` stamped every
network with zone `"lan"` and no screen ever set it. So every VLAN network asked
for a second firewall zone named `lan` beside the device's own, carrying `input
REJECT` and `forward REJECT`.

Zones are now rendered once per zone, holding their networks as a UCI **list** —
also the only form that can hold more than one. And the ownership rule now
covers the namespace fw4 actually keys on: our section name would not have
collided and the *zone* would, so a zone name the device already uses is a
conflict rather than something to write a duplicate of. `Conflict`'s own doc
comment always said *"a colliding name **or a conflicting function**"*; only the
first half had ever been implemented. New networks default to a zone named after
themselves, which is what the renderer's own fallback already assumed.

#### A nil capability record panicked in the half that writes

`radiosByBand`, `radioBySection` and `withLiveChannels` all check for nil.
`renderNetwork` and `bridgeIsVLANAware` did not. Not reachable from the daemon —
`deviceCaps` never returns a nil registry without an error — but a contract half
a package honours is not a contract, and the half ignoring it was the half that
decides what gets written.

#### What the mutation pass cost, and caught

Fifteen mutations across the four fixes, all killed — but **not on the first
attempt, and the reason is worth keeping.** The first round used
`git checkout <file>` to undo each mutation while the *fixes themselves were
still uncommitted*, so every "undo" silently reverted the fix as well. Three of
five mutations then "failed" against code that had no fix in it at all. The
evidence looked like a clean kill sheet and meant nothing.

*Mutation testing needs a known-good baseline, and `git checkout` only restores
the last commit. Commit the fix first, or restore from a file copy.*

Once the harness was honest, two mutations survived and exposed genuinely
untested branches — the `Retain` path, and the wired blindness — both of which
needed new tests. Three more tests exist purely to stop the fix becoming *"never
delete anything"*: a device whose radio list was **read** and was empty still
prunes, a device in no AP group still prunes, and a gate that decided **against**
the device — the driver will not run a mesh point — still prunes.

#### Checked and left alone

- **`ReadExisting` fails closed.** A denied `uci get` returns ubus status 6 and
  errors the whole plan; only status 4 (genuinely no such config) is skipped. The
  read seam that would have fed `Prune` a false empty is already shut.
- **`MobilityDomain` is derived, not stored** — every AP computes the same value
  from (site UUID, WLAN id) with no coordination, which is the property that
  makes fan-out ordering irrelevant.
- **`Uplink.Validate` covers the dangling-WLAN case** before `Render` can reach
  it, so the unreported `!found` branch in the uplink block is unreachable rather
  than silent.

#### Carried forward to the `reconcile` review

`flatten` maps a UCI list and a space-joined string option to the same Go value,
so `plan.matches` cannot tell them apart. A section holding `option ports 'lan1:t
lan2:t'` where UCI wants `list ports` reads as **"already matches"** and is never
corrected — and that exact malformed write is the one `Section.Lists` documents
as having taken the LAN down *after a confirmed, healthy apply*. Nothing writes
that form today; a previous version of us did. The fix belongs in `flatten`,
which is where the type is discarded.

---

### 5at. Reconcile's first review — and the regression the render fix caused

**Done 2026-08-17.** `reconcile` is the only package that both reads a device and
writes the store. Four findings; the first is one **§5as caused**, which is the
argument for reviewing the consequences of a fix rather than only the fix.

#### Un-adopt would have left our config behind on a device we could not see

`ReplaceOwned` replaces rather than merges, and its comment states the premise
outright: *an apply prunes every owned section absent from the document, so
after a confirmed apply the device holds exactly the rendered set.* §5as's
`Retain` and `Blind` made that premise false **on purpose** — a device whose
radios or ports could not be read now keeps its sections instead of having them
deleted.

So the record began dropping claims for sections still on the device and still
carrying our marker. That is not bookkeeping. `daemon.ownedSections` reads
exactly this table to decide what un-adopt reverts, so a forgotten claim means
oonfeeWRT **can never remove that config again** — it stays on a device the
operator was told had been cleaned. The fleet detail joins against the same
table to tell our BSSes from a stranger's, so our own SSID would start
reporting as foreign.

Claims are now carried forward *unchanged* — we did not re-apply them, and
restamping the hash would date a change that never happened — and only while
the section is still **ours on the device**, because the record is what
un-adopt deletes and a claim on a section a human has taken over is the
controller deleting their config on the way out.

**The lesson is the shape of the bug, not the bug.** A fix that changes an
invariant has to be checked against everything that ever relied on it, and the
comment on `ReplaceOwned` had written the invariant down in plain English. It
was still missed, because the fix and the reliance are in different packages.

#### A malformed list was indistinguishable from a correct one, so it was permanent

Carried into this review from §5as. `flatten` renders a UCI list space-joined,
which is how `uci get` prints one — and that maps two different configs onto one
Go string:

```
list ports 'lan1:t' + list ports 'lan2:t'  ->  "lan1:t lan2:t"
option ports 'lan1:t lan2:t'               ->  "lan1:t lan2:t"
```

netifd honours the first and silently ignores the second. `Section.Lists`
records what the second cost when measured: accepted by `uci.set`, stored,
VLAN filtering on with no untagged membership, **and the LAN down after the
apply had already been confirmed healthy.**

`plan.matches` compared the joined text, found it equal, and reported "already
matches" — so a device holding the malformed form **could never be repaired by
the thing that wrote it.** Nothing writes that form today; a previous version of
us did, which is exactly the config still sitting on devices adopted then.

`flatten` now records which options arrived as JSON arrays, under a dotted key
alongside UCI's own `.type` and `.name`. Three-state, because both guesses fail:
absent means "nobody recorded this" — every hand-built `Existing` — and guessing
there would either mask the malformed form or rewrite every correct list on
every plan, turning each preview into changes that change nothing. A section
with **no** lists records the empty string rather than going silent, or the one
case worth catching would be the one that looks unknown.

#### The repair assumed something nobody had measured

The detection above stages a set carrying a JSON array, which relies on rpcd's
`uci.set` converting a string option into a list. **That is not measured
anywhere in this repository**, and the failure if it does not is the silent one
the fix exists to remove.

So the malformed option is deleted first, in the same staged batch (`ubus.Batch`
preserves order, and nothing commits until `uci.apply`). Only for the malformed
shape — a correctly-stored list whose content changed is still a plain set.

*Still worth measuring when a device is free: if `uci.set` does convert, the
delete is merely redundant. Assuming it does and being wrong is unrecoverable
from the controller.*

#### Drift was blind to list options, so a human edit to them was reverted in silence

The package opens by saying drift is *"surfaced, never silently corrected — the
operator may have had a good reason, and a controller that quietly reverts human
edits is worse than one that does not notice them."*

`detectDrift` built its comparison from `s.Values` alone. A human editing `list
ports` on a bridge-VLAN we own produced **no drift at all**: the section hash was
unchanged from what we applied, correctly ruling it out as our own pending edit,
and then nothing looked at the lists. `plan.matches` saw the difference and
staged a set, so the edit was put back on the next apply with nothing said.

Of every option class to be blind to, this is the worst one — a bridge-VLAN's
port membership is exactly where the malformed form took the LAN down.

Second gap in the same loop: `if have, ok := current[k]; ok && ...` skipped any
option the device no longer has, so *"a human deleted our option"* was not drift
either, and was likewise restored in silence. Deletions are reported now, but
**only when there is a recorded applied hash** — without one, a missing option is
indistinguishable from an option this version of the renderer has only just
started writing, and accusing an operator of deleting something we never applied
is the false drift the whole mechanism was built to stop.

#### Two tests were passing on nothing

Both new ownership tests initially passed without exercising a single line of
the code under test. The mock ubus server is **shared and stateful across the
package**, so by the time they ran the device already matched the site model,
the plan was empty, and `Apply` returned at its `p.Empty()` guard before
touching the store. `forceOp` now guarantees a non-empty plan and fails loudly
if it cannot.

This is the same class as §5as's mutation-harness error, one layer up: *a test
that never reached its subject looks exactly like a test that passed.*

#### Checked and left alone

- **`ReadExisting` fails closed.** A denied `uci get` returns ubus status 6 and
  errors the whole plan; only status 4, genuinely no such config, is skipped.
- **Ownership is recorded only on `Applied`.** Not on `Reverted`, which would
  claim config that is not there, and not on `Unknown`, which needs a human.
- **`logOutcome` writes an audit event for every apply, including failures** —
  and its severity mapping already treats `Unknown` as an error rather than
  folding it in with `Reverted`.

#### Known and not fixed

`Apply` calls `r.Store` unguarded while `PlanDevice` checks it for nil. A
`Reconciler` built without `New` would panic there. Left as it is: `New` is the
only constructor in the tree, so guarding would add a branch nothing can reach —
§6's rule about guards that cannot fire cuts both ways.

---

### 5au. Capability's first review — the sweep's last package, and its own rule broken outside it

**Done 2026-08-17.** `capability` is the most carefully written package in the
tree, and the review bears that out: its probes separate denied from failed
almost everywhere, `verdict` encodes the three-state rule *structurally* so a
new feature cannot reach `Absent` without calling `demonstrated(Absent)`, and
`diff.go` handles every state transition including the ones that must not read
as a loss.

The serious finding was **not in the package. It was in everyone who used it.**

#### Unknown was rendered as Absent in every gate that decides what gets written

`State` has four values, and `Buildable()` has grouped them correctly since the
package was written: *"Unknown and NotObservable mean we do not know."* Nothing
else did. Five sites switched on `NotObservable` alone and let `Unknown` fall
through to the `Absent` branch:

| site | what it told the operator |
|---|---|
| `MeshGate` | "this device's wpad build does not carry 802.11s. Installing a wpad-mesh-* package would provide it" |
| `UplinkGate` | "this device has no wireless supplicant installed, so it can serve a network and cannot join one" |
| `daemon/neighbors` | "this device's hostapd does not carry the 802.11k neighbour-report methods" |
| `daemon/rolefit` | "this device reported no radios" — and change the role |
| `render.undetermined` | nothing; it just let `Prune` **delete the interface** |

Every one a definite claim about hardware, derived from a check that never ran.
§5q is explicit that telling someone to install a package they already have is
worse than saying nothing, and here the controller says it about a device it
never asked.

**Unknown is not exotic, and this is the part that matters.** A capability
record is JSON and `Unknown` is the zero value, so a record written before a
`Feature` existed has no key for it. Every device adopted before a feature was
added reads `Unknown` for it — *permanently, until re-probed*. Adding any new
`Feature` therefore makes this reachable across the entire existing fleet at
once. **It is a bug that gets worse with every release rather than better**,
which is why it is worth more than the four defects it resembles.

`State.Decided()` now names the grouping the package already documented, in the
package that owns it, and all five sites use it. `NotObservable` keeps its own
message wherever one existed: *"the check was refused"* and *"no answer was ever
recorded"* send an operator to different remedies, and collapsing those two
would be the same mistake one level up.

#### A denied call inside a batch was recorded as the device mishandling batches

`probeBatching` sent two calls and, on anything other than two clean results,
recorded `FeatBatching` **Absent** — "device did not answer a 2-call batch
correctly; polls will be sequential". A member call the ACL refused lands in
that branch and says nothing about batching: the batch *was* carried, answered
and correlated, which is exactly what the check tests.

This is the one verdict in the file that is spent silently on every poll for the
life of the adoption. A device wrongly graded Absent polls sequentially forever
and nothing revisits it.

Extracted into `batchVerdict` so the rule is testable without a device, the way
`meshFromPackages` already is — the split that let the mesh rule be verified at
all.

#### Checked and left alone

- **`verdict` is the right shape.** `present` beats `absent` beats
  `refused`/`undetermined`, and the type makes the safe answer the easy one.
  Its `default: Absent` is reached only when radios were enumerated, because
  `probeRadios` returns early with explicit `NotObservable` on both refusal
  paths.
- **`probeMesh` handles the hardest case in the package correctly**: the daemon
  carries mesh, but the per-driver check needs a hardware name that iwinfo only
  reports for a radio with an interface — so it records `NotObservable` rather
  than the clean bill that once flipped a Marvell radio to Present.
- **`installedPackages` tries both managers** and returns an error only when
  neither answered, so a mid-migration device is not read as having no packages.
- **`diff.featureChange` never reports a `NotObservable` transition as a loss**,
  and treats a first determination as first rather than as a gain.

#### The sweep is finished

Nine packages, five review sections (§5ag, §5aq, §5ar, §5as, §5at, §5au),
**fifteen defects.** Every one of them sat in the same seam — the gap between
what was asked and what came back — and the three worst were all the same
sentence: *a question nobody answered, spent as though it were an answer.*

- §5as: a refused radio list **deleted every interface** on the device.
- §5at: a broken invariant meant un-adopt **could never remove our own config**.
- §5au: a missing record entry **told the operator their hardware lacks a
  feature**, and will do it to the whole fleet on the next feature added.

The pattern is worth more than the list. **Find the values that have a "we do
not know" state, and check every consumer — especially the ones that DELETE, and
the ones that produce a sentence an operator will act on.**

### 5av. Pointing the code at the real devices, and what the mock could never say

**Done 2026-08-17.** The review sweep (§5as–§5au) fixed nine defects with a green
suite and never touched a device. This is what happened when it did.

`tools/dryrun` opens the store read-only, reads each device over ubus, renders
the live site model and plans it. It writes nothing — no migration, stage,
apply or commit — so it is safe against a live fleet with the daemon up.

#### The end-to-end result: both devices, 0 ops, 0 prunes

Which is the confirmation that mattered. The `flatten` change touches **every**
plan and the `Retain`/`Blind` change touches **every** prune, and neither
produced a single spurious operation against the real WRT3200ACM or Archer C6.

#### A board that reported its layout was being called unreadable

`probePorts` fails by leaving `Bridge` **empty**. It sets `Bridge` from
`lan.Device`, with no LAN ports, for a board whose LAN is a single interface
rather than a set of individually taggable switch ports — a successful read of a
real layout. The Archer C6 reports exactly that: **bridge `eth0.1`, no LAN
ports, DSA Absent.** A swconfig board.

Two things treated that as a failed read.

**Mine, from §5as.** The wired-blindness test was `Bridge == "" || len(LAN) ==
0`, so the C6 was marked blind for `network`, `dhcp` and `firewall`, and `Prune`
was disabled there. The safe direction — and still the same conflation this
whole sweep is about, "could not ask" against "asked, and got an answer", now
applied to every swconfig board in existence.

**Pre-existing.** The omission read *"this device did not report its wired port
layout"*, which is false. It sends an operator to widen an ACL and re-probe a
device that answered the first time. The truth is that the board has no
individually taggable ports and its wired VLANs live in swconfig, which
oonfeeWRT does not manage — a different problem with a different remedy.

**No test in this repository could have found it**, and that is the point worth
keeping. The mock does not know what a swconfig board reports. The suite was
green through the entire sweep while the reference hardware was being described
back to its owner incorrectly.

#### Three uci semantics measured, after three fixes had guessed at them

Run against the C6 over rpcd, staged only and reverted; both devices re-read
from a fresh session afterwards and confirmed clean — no staged changes, no
stray sections. Recorded in IMPLEMENTATION §14.

1. **`uci.set` with a JSON array DOES convert an existing string option into a
   list.** §5at deletes the option first because nobody had measured this. The
   delete stays — one firmware measured, and the failure if another build does
   not convert is the silent one — but the comment now states the measurement
   rather than the absence of one.

2. **A missing config is status 4; a config the ACL does not grant is status
   6.** `reconcile.isMissingConfig` keys on 4 and is **correct**. Verified with
   `oonfeewrt_probe`, which the ACL grants and which has no file, against
   `ddns`, which is not in the ACL. Worth recording because the ACL is consulted
   first, so a status 6 alone does not mean the config exists.

3. **A missing OPTION returns status 0 with an empty body, never 4 or 5.** So
   does a missing section. That makes `applyengine.snapshotPlanned`'s
   `NotFound`/`NoData` branch **unreachable** on this firmware, and an option
   that does not exist is recorded as `found=true, value=""` — the opposite of
   what `preApply`'s doc claimed. The verdict is unaffected, because
   `planStillApplied` only asks whether the value equals what was written and
   `""` never equals a non-empty want, so a reverted add still reads as
   reverted. The branch is kept as insurance for builds that answer with a
   status, and the doc now says so rather than describing a state that cannot
   occur here.

**The general lesson: an empty answer from rpcd is not always an error status.**
Any check that identifies "absent" by waiting for a non-zero status will
silently never fire against this firmware.

#### A layer-2 loop warning was filed under "not an error"

Found by reading the apply preview rather than the packages. It rendered every
omission under one heading:

> *"Left out on this device (not an error — the hardware or firmware cannot take
> it)"*

True of about four of the nineteen omissions the renderer can produce. Two of
the others describe a network that stops working — an unencrypted mesh anyone in
range can join, and a wireless bridge that is a layer-2 loop if the device is
also cabled — and both sat in muted grey directly beneath the reassurance. They
are the only two conditions in the whole renderer an operator must decide about
*before* applying.

§5as made it worse: the sections kept in place because the device could not be
read were added to the same list, so *"the existing wireless uplink section is
left exactly as it is"* appeared under a heading saying it had been left out.

`Omission` now carries a `Kind`, the preview routes by it, and each list gets a
heading true of its contents — cautions in a warning banner **above** the change
list rather than in grey below it. The zero value is unclassified and falls to a
neutral heading, because a kind nobody set must not inherit an assertion about
hardware nobody checked.

That is the **forty-eighth** defect found by looking at a screen, and none of
them was reachable by a test in this repository.

---

### 5aw. Turning 802.11r off did nothing at all — and the round trip that proved it

**Done 2026-08-17.** The plan was a small apply against real hardware to close
the gap §5av named. Choosing which option to toggle found the worst defect of
the day, and the apply then became the proof that the fix works.

#### A switch with no off position

`plan.matches` compares only the keys we **write**. An option written under a
condition and then no longer written is never compared and never cleared. So
every one of these could be turned on and not off:

| setting | options left on the device |
|---|---|
| 802.11r | `ieee80211r`, `mobility_domain`, `reassociation_deadline` |
| 802.11k/v | `ieee80211k`, `rrm_*`, `bss_transition`, `wnm_sleep_mode` |
| Hide SSID / client isolation | `hidden`, `isolate` |
| client limit | `maxassoc` |
| switching a WLAN to Open | `ieee80211w`, **and the PSK in `key`** |

Measured against **both** reference devices before the fix: setting
`Roaming.FT = false` produced **ZERO operations**. The preview reported
*"already matches — nothing to do"*, and `ieee80211r=1` with its mobility
domain stayed on the air.

`wds` already got this right, with a comment in the same function explaining
exactly why it writes both directions — *"a stale one is a security posture
nobody chose"*. Four siblings beside it did not.

**On the WRT3200ACM this is the sharp one.** §5an established that the radio
wedges 85 seconds after an 802.11r roam, and the mitigation rests on turning
something off. An operator reaching for the obvious remedy — disable fast
transition — would get a confirmed apply, a UI showing the feature disabled,
and a device still running FT into the next wedge. The controller would have
lied about the one setting the project spent a day root-causing.

**The fix.** Flags are written in both directions. `maxassoc` is the exception
and the reason `Section.Manages` exists: hostapd does not read `maxassoc 0` as
"no limit", so there is no safe value for "unset" and the option is deleted
instead. Deletes are emitted **only** for options the device actually holds,
because `stage()` aborts the whole batch on a failed op.

`TestNoFlagChangesWhichOptionsExist` is the structural guard: turning every flag
off must not change *which* options are written, only their values. Any future
`if flag {` with no `else` fails it — the mistake `wds` documented and four
siblings then made anyway.

**Two existing tests asserted key ABSENCE** where the invariant is "not
enabled", so they passed throughout and had to be corrected to assert the state.

**A second defect fell out**: switching a WLAN to Open now deletes the stale
`key`. The passphrase used to sit in `/etc/config/wireless` on a network that no
longer had a password.

#### The round trip, on both devices

The first real apply since §5ap, on today's code, and the first ever to exercise
`flatten`'s list marker, `Retain`/`Blind`, `Manages` and the ownership
carry-forward.

The change was chosen to be behaviour-neutral: `hidden: "" -> "0"` and
`isolate: "" -> "0"`, four options per device, all writing the value UCI already
defaults to. What is being tested is the machinery, not the setting.

```
Archer C6      2 ops   health passed, confirm landed   446ms
WRT3200ACM     2 ops   health passed, confirm landed   134ms
```

Verified **from a fresh ubus session** on each device, because confirm is
session-bound and the applying session's view proves nothing:

- both options committed and visible on disk
- **no staged changes left** — nothing stranded in `/tmp/.uci`
- both radios still broadcasting `example-managed-wlan`, ch36 and ch1
- `ieee80211r` and `ieee80211w` unchanged — nothing moved that was not asked for
- `owned_sections` re-hashed with a fresh `applied_at`, and the two devices
  agree on both hashes, which is what identical rendered content should produce
- a re-plan reports **0 ops, 0 prunes** on both: idempotent

#### The pre-flight audit that produced nothing

A five-agent adversarial audit of the apply path was run before touching
hardware. **All five agents died on a session limit and it returned zero
findings.** Recorded because a zero-finding result that arrives from five
crashed agents looks exactly like a clean bill of health, and this file exists
mostly to stop that kind of thing being believed later. The verification that
actually happened is the one above, done by hand.

#### Tools added

- `tools/optdiff` — the option-level diff a plan would make, read-only. This is
  what made the apply safe to authorise: four options, all inert, printed before
  anything was staged.
- `tools/applyone` — applies to ONE device, named explicitly, so a fleet cannot
  be changed by a mistyped argument.
- `tools/stalecheck` — renders the live model with a setting turned OFF and
  reports what the plan would leave behind. This is what found the defect.

---

### 5ax. The message audit, the network editor, and an evening lost to two cables

**Done 2026-08-18.** Thirteen commits. Roughly half came from a single question
the operator asked about a warning triangle, and the other half from a network
outage that turned out not to be a bug at all — but which exposed three that
were.

#### "I'm not actually sure what to do"

Said about a firewall-zone warning that read *"lan is a firewall zone the device
already has. oonfeeWRT does not edit zones it did not write, so this network
will be refused at preview until it has a zone of its own."* Every word true,
and it never says what to type.

That sentence had been written **an hour earlier**, by me, in the same session
that added STATUS §6's rule about advice that names an action. Knowing the rule
is not the same as applying it.

It now names the action and an example derived from the network's own name, and
the full sentence is printed under the card rather than living only in a `title`
attribute. The same pass found the `lan` row on VLAN 1 was flagged too and had
nothing wrong with it — `renderNetwork` returns early for VLAN 0 and 1, so no
zone renders and the warning was noise on the one row where no action exists.

#### A 36-agent audit of every operator-facing message

Four surfaces, adversarially verified: **32 findings raised, 24 confirmed, 8
refuted, 4 of them advice that cannot be followed.**

The sharpest was `render.go`'s `hardware-unidentified` mitigation — *"Apply a
WLAN and re-probe"* — which STATUS §6 already records as the lesson about
unfollowable advice. It has two trigger arms and the advice only works for one.
When the radio LIST was refused, `radiosByBand` returns empty, no wifi-iface
renders at all, and there is no WLAN to apply. §5as fixed the *deletion* that
condition caused and left the sentence standing.

Two more had been made false **that same morning**: the clients grid's signal
and access-point tooltips still said those come "from the focused poll tier",
hours after `c822765` moved both to the baseline hostapd read.

Nine of the twenty no-remedy findings were fixed in one pass — the two conflict
reasons above all, because a conflict blocks the whole apply and *"a section
with our name exists but is not ours"* named no section, no marker and no lever.
`readoptFix` says the one action behind four separate "could not read this"
messages once, so they cannot drift apart. **At this point the audit still had
eleven UI findings.** §5ba closes all eleven.

#### The clients grid threw away the answer it already had

The operator reported a phone and a watch connected and every radio column
reading unknown. Both were associated the whole time, and hostapd was reporting
them at −46 and −50 dBm.

`decodeAPClients` unmarshalled the MAC-keyed map and kept `len()`:

```go
n := len(v.Clients)
s.ap(iface).Clients = &n
```

`get_clients` carries each MAC with its RSSI, bytes, packets, rate and airtime,
and runs at the **baseline** rate. Three of the four empty columns were
answerable for free, gated behind a tier that exists to pay for per-station
reads. Only TX retries genuinely needs the focused tier.

A hazard worth keeping: on the same device in the same minute,
`iwinfo.assoclist` returns `<client-mac>` and `hostapd.get_clients` returns
`<client-mac>`, and the clients table stores lower case. **A join that does
not normalise misses every row and looks exactly like an empty result** — which
is the failure the operator was staring at.

#### "radio radio0 is gone", about a radio carrying the SSID

Found by finally opening the apply preview, which §5av's own guidance had
recommended and I had not done.

`diff.go` has rename-pairing for exactly this, added two days earlier, whose
comment says every radio was once reported lost AND gained "with 'WLANs targeted
at its band will not render' attached to hardware that was working". It pairs on
`HWModes` and guards `len(a.HWModes) == 0` — **the new side only.** The stored
event shows the empty side was the old one. A disappearance with no mode
evidence is `EffectAmbiguous` now, and deliberately not actionable.

Then the remedy for it did not work either, twice over:

1. `recentCapabilityLoss` scanned back five events for the first *actionable*
   one, so a clean re-probe never superseded an old loss. Narrowed to the newest.
2. That still failed, because **`logReprobe` returns early on `res.Unchanged`
   and writes nothing at all.** The operator re-probed exactly as advised and
   the screen did not move. Every probe now writes
   `device.capabilities_probed`, so "nothing has changed since" is a statement
   the preview can check.

Point 2 was caught only because someone followed the instruction and said it did
not work. Point 1 was written *while fixing this same class*.

#### Networks became a real screen

The card was a stack of flex rows with fields inline — nothing lined up, and the
bare number after the name had no column header saying it was a VLAN. It uses
`DataGrid` now, the same component the clients and devices screens use.

A network could previously be **created and deleted and nothing else**. Clicking
a row opens an editor in the shared `SlideOver`: name, VLAN, zone, enabled,
address, with the zone warning live. Below the address it derives what UniFi
shows — gateway, netmask, broadcast, usable count, DHCP range, lease — and says
plainly that those are **read-only**, because `render/network.go` hardcodes the
pool and presenting them as settings would be inventing controls that go
nowhere. This was true at the time; §5ba supersedes it with the configurable,
validated DHCP path.

The trap both editors needed pinning: `handleSaveNetwork` rebuilds the record
from what it is sent, so **a partial post blanks the VLAN and the address**.

#### An evening lost to two cables, and three defects it exposed

The operator reported the devices gone and re-adoption failing. Cause: **two USB
ethernet adapters on the same `192.0.2.0/24`**, so macOS marked the subnet
routes `RTF_REJECT`. Go's non-blocking `connect()` got `EHOSTUNREACH`
immediately while `curl`, `ping` and Python — all blocking connects — kept
working. Every shell tool said the routers were fine; the controller could not
reach them.

Not a controller bug. But it cost an evening and it produced three real ones:

1. **Discovery reported `found=0`** with no hint that the controller's own host
   could not reach the subnet. "Unroutable from here" and "nothing there" are
   different facts and it reported the second. **This is what led to working
   devices being deleted.** It was not fixed at this point; §5ba records the
   routed-failure result and UI that close it.
2. **A routing change needs a daemon restart**, silently. A fresh process
   connected while the running daemon kept failing, and the adopt error said
   `no route to host` when the route was fine.
3. **The controller owned config it had no record of.** The un-adopt ran while
   routing was broken so the config stayed; re-adoption then rendered exactly
   what was there, the plan was empty, and `Apply` returned at its `p.Empty()`
   guard before recording anything. Ownership is what un-adopt reverts, so it
   would have walked away and left two marked sections per device. The same hole
   §5at closed on the applying path, reached from the other side.

`applyone` had the same early return and so could not exercise the path it was
meant to test.

### 5ay. Re-baselining against UniFi Network 10.5

**Researched 2026-08-18 against Ubiquiti's live release feed and official help
articles.** The current stable Network application is **10.5.67**. UniFi OS
5.1.26 is the stable Dream Machine train; 5.1.27 is its release candidate, while
Cloud Gateways and Dream Routers are on platform-specific 5.1.28 candidates.
The stable interface target in `UI-SPEC.md` and
`PARITY-MATRIX.md` had still been 10.4.57.

The visual refresh is real, but the important change is functional:

- **Client Observability** is now a single 24-hour investigation surface. A
  client list and event spine drive correlated Client Health, AP Health and
  Site Health charts, roaming/AP history, application use and connection logs.
  oonfeeWRT has many inputs already and presents them on separate screens. The
  missing product is the joined timeline and shared cursor, not another metric
  card.
- **Safe Ops** makes Test & Confirm, recovery thresholds and link protections a
  first-class settings surface. Phase 0 already implements the hard part more
  rigorously than a visual imitation would: device-owned rollback, pre-confirm
  health, three outcomes and per-option disruption warnings. The next parity
  step is consistent presentation. Automatic recovery must begin monitor-only
  and stay capability/consent-gated on third-party OpenWrt hardware.
- Infrastructure Topology now records uplink changes, wired downlinks,
  third-party connections and grouped cascades. That belongs with Phase 4's
  topology history, not with a static graph alone.
- The current control plane also emphasizes a unified Policy Engine, structured
  logs/CEF, Alarm Manager trigger→scope→action rules, customizable flow views,
  Channel AI recommendations, backups and centralized updates. The existing
  phases already have homes for all of these; the parity documents now describe
  their current shape.

**What this does to the queue:** it does not move a glossy Phase-4 screen ahead
of the failures already known. The first two items in the research-time order—
unroutable discovery and the eleven operator-message findings—are now closed in
§5ba. At research time, the remaining order was:

1. hardware-prove Phase 3's configurable-DHCP and network/zone LIST path;
2. build Phase 3's directional Zone Matrix and unified Policy Engine master
   table, then add Object Manager as an outcome-to-visible-rules workflow;
3. build Phase 4 around the Client Observability timeline as its spine, then
   topology history, Radios and structured logs;
4. add Alarm Manager and bounded recovery in Phase 6; keep DPI-dependent
   application identity and flows in Phase 5 and capability-gated.

The OpenWrt ecosystem goal adds a parallel proof requirement to every phase:
test across release generation, package manager, switch architecture, radio
driver and resource class. A third MT7621/Filogic-class router remains more
valuable than another UI card because it adds another switch/radio generation,
802.11ax and—if kept on an older release—the opkg compatibility path.

§5bd supersedes item 2 for the whole-zone forwarding subset: the directional
matrix and its effective Master Table are built. Object Manager and the wider
cross-rule-type table remain.

### 5az. Two-router no-install capability pass

**Done 2026-08-18 against both lab routers. No package was installed, removed
or upgraded.** Both answer pinned-key SSH and report OpenWrt 25.12.5
`r33051-f5dae5ece4`, kernel 6.12.94. The standard read-only probe completed
without a hard failure on each device.

| | WRT3200ACM | Archer C6 v2 |
|---|---:|---:|
| controller class | A | **C**, now keyed from measured QCA956X silicon rather than left `?` by the generic `ath79` target |
| usable RAM | 494 MiB | 117 MiB (nominal 128 MB) |
| free overlay | 50.1 MB | **6.4 MB** |
| focused 1 Hz probe window, whole-device CPU | 1.28% | 7.00% |
| keep-alive median | 1.3 ms | 4.7 ms |
| bridge FDB | stock `brctl` | stock `brctl` |
| switch ports | DSA/native ubus | stock `swconfig`: link, VLAN, ARL and MIB counters |

The two-minute shipped-cadence budget harness ran on the constrained C6 and
passed: 1.00 poll/min idle, 6.00 requests/min focused, 7/7 polls successful,
zero detected flash writes and 5.43% whole-device CPU across the mixed run. It
is a useful gate and closes the claim that no constrained router had ever been
measured. It does **not** replace DEVICE-BUDGET's 60-minute per-release
acceptance run or establish attributable CPU milliseconds per poll.

The no-package topology/ports finding changes the capability model:

- DSA now means DSA-specific configuration, not “the Ports screen exists”.
- `switch-port-stats` is independently Present through DSA or legacy
  `swconfig`; the C6 gets a read-only Ports experience instead of losing the
  screen.
- `bridge-fdb` is independently Present through stock `brctl`, with
  `bridge -j fdb` as a fallback. LLDP becomes optional enrichment instead of a
  baseline-topology prerequisite.
- The production ACL adds only exact read-only grants for `brctl showmacs *`,
  `swconfig list` and `swconfig dev * show`. The same file was staged and
  installed on both routers. Its SHA-256 matched the repository on each.

The ACL was tested through a temporary login carrying only the `oonfeewrt`
group. `brctl` passed on both; both `swconfig` reads passed on the C6 and were
clean `NOT_FOUND` on the DSA WRT. `/bin/sh` and `apk add lldpd` were both denied
with ubus status 6. The temporary login and its live sessions were removed by
deleting the UCI section and restarting rpcd; both routers then refused it.
The previous ACL remains at `/tmp/oonfeewrt.json.before` on each router until
reboot as a recovery copy.

The first scoped Go probe passed on the WRT and failed on the C6 for a useful
reason: board JSON calls the swconfig LAN UCI device `eth0.1`, while the running
Linux bridge whose FDB must be read is `br-lan`. The renderer's UCI target and
the topology collector's runtime bridge are now separate fields. Re-run through
the restricted login passed on both devices: the WRT reports class A + DSA +
switch-port stats + FDB; the C6 reports class C + DSA Absent + legacy
switch-port stats + FDB.

Both routers also re-passed the scratch `uci.apply {rollback:true}` proof:
confirm preserved `v2`; withholding confirm restored `v2` from `v3` through a
fresh session. The empty scratch files were then removed and `uci changes` was
empty. That first attempt exposed a probe bug: a missing scratch file printed a
hard `NOT_FOUND` failure but exited 0. `probe.py` now exits 1 whenever its report
contains a hard failure.

The C6's 6.4 MB overlay also tightens the package rule. “More than 3 MB free”
is not enough to call optional installs broadly viable. Below 8 MB, built-ins
win and the default is no installation unless the exact package plus dependency
size is known and recovery headroom remains. Nothing currently needed justifies
adding `lldpd`, `ethtool`, `nlbwmon`, `vnstat`, `usteer` or `dawn` to either
router.

The final live dry run found **0 set/add operations and 0 prunes on both
routers**. Closing that check exposed one local safety defect before it could
become a habit: `dryrun -h` was treated as a SQLite filename, and the ordinary
store opener could create or migrate a database despite the tool's read-only
claim. The CLI now requires one existing regular file, and the store has a
read-only opener enforced by SQLite `mode=ro` plus `query_only`; it also refuses
an old schema instead of migrating it. Regression tests prove writes fail, the
database bytes remain unchanged, paths containing spaces/`#`/`%` resolve to the
right file, nonexistent paths are not created, and `-h` is only help.

Final blast-radius checks passed after these changes: uncached `go test ./...`,
full `go test -race ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `govulncheck`, all 107 UI tests,
`npm audit`, the production UI build and 114 KB gzip budget, Python compilation,
ACL JSON parse, working-tree secret scan, amd64/arm64 static cross-builds and
`git diff --check`.

### 5ba. Route truth, fail-closed removal, message closure and configurable DHCP

**Implemented and regression-tested 2026-08-18 in the current working tree;
no router was mutated for this pass.** This section supersedes §5ax's open
discovery/message queue and its statement that DHCP is read-only.

**Discovery now distinguishes “empty” from “not scanned successfully.”** A
network whose every connection attempt returns `EHOSTUNREACH` or
`ENETUNREACH` appears in the additive API `failures` list with its CIDR and
attempt count. The Discover screen suppresses the ordinary “nothing answered”
message for that case and says the scan establishes nothing about whether
devices are present; it directs the operator to the controller host's routes
and interfaces. A normally reachable subnet on which nothing fingerprints as
OpenWrt remains an honest empty result.

**Un-adopt now fails closed on its load-bearing input.** Device detail always
emits `owned_sections_known`; the UI treats only literal `true` as authority to
interpret `owned_sections`, so older servers and read failures both stay safe.
Loading, known-empty and unreadable are separate states, and both “Remove
completely” and “Revert config only” remain disabled until the ledger is known.
When cleanup is partial—or the inventory record is forced away—the structured
report survives and includes exact, validated stock-OpenWrt `uci`/`rm` commands
plus verification commands for only the residue actually left. Unexpected
internal identifiers or paths produce no root command.

**All eleven findings left by §5ax's operator-message audit are closed:**

1. Un-adopt no longer treats an unreadable ownership ledger as an empty one.
2. Forced/partial un-adopt preserves and renders exact cleanup commands.
3. The passwordless-root warning now gives `ssh -t 'user@host' passwd` and LuCI
   `System → Administration → Router Password`, and says the controller will
   not modify `/etc/shadow` or set the password.
4. Adopt and Un-adopt expose the backend's optional SSH private-key input. The
   key is for SSH only; during adoption the password still signs in to ubus,
   while un-adopt uses the supplied key/password only for SSH cleanup. Neither
   is persisted, echoed or logged.
5. Device detail separates standing permission/firmware/driver limitations
   from current transport/protocol/decode poll failures and shows the recorded
   cause plus ubus status where one exists.
6. Airtime/survey notes say “not observable” when the check failed and reserve
   driver-absence language for an answer that actually proved absence.
7. `roleFit` no longer turns every `NotObservable` radio inventory into a
   claimed ACL refusal; it points to the recorded cause before prescribing
   re-adoption.
8. A precise per-band unknown omission is no longer followed by a generic “no
   matching radio” sentence that makes unknown sound absent.
9. Dashboard's unknown client-count banner now names the device-detail path and
   distinguishes re-probing a transient failure from re-adopting a permanent
   permission gap.
10. Clients' unknown-scope explanation includes an unreadable subnet source and
    the same cause-aware remedy instead of implying only missing addresses.
11. Client connection/AP/signal copy now says those values come from baseline
    hostapd reads; only TX retries waits for the focused iwinfo tier.

The adjacent client connection filter and live overlay now use the same
wireless/unknown classification, so selecting a filter does not disagree with
the row that updates beneath it.

**DHCP is now site-model state rather than a renderer constant.** The network
editor, API, store, model and renderer round-trip `enabled`, `start`, `limit`
and `leasetime`; a missing legacy value keeps `100`/`150`/`12h`, and an older
client omitting the object preserves the stored policy. Incomplete explicit
objects, malformed/unusable gateway CIDRs, pools outside the subnet, pools that
contain the gateway and invalid lease units are rejected without mutating the
site or reaching a device plan. Turning DHCP off removes the owned server;
re-enabling clears a stale `ignore 1`. An AP never renders a competing server,
VLAN 0/1 management addressing stays operator-owned, and a foreign DHCP section
or firewall zone blocks the plan rather than being rewritten. The controller
still refuses to enable VLAN filtering on a flat bridge.

**At this point, what remained for Phase 3 was proof and policy, not another
DHCP form.** Apply a
non-default pool/lease and the multi-network firewall-zone LIST form to a
disposable router with Gateway selected whose bridge is already VLAN-aware, then prove
disable/re-enable and cleanup. After that, the current UniFi pattern is an
inspectable Policy Engine master table, an Object Manager that compiles
`Secure`/`Route`/`QoS` outcomes into those visible rules, and a directional Zone
Matrix whose rows are sources and columns are destinations. Those policy
surfaces were targets in this checkpoint; §5bd supersedes that statement for
the directional whole-zone subset only.

### 5bb. Per-device operation safety, SSH hardening and live verification

**Implemented and verified 2026-08-18 in the current working tree and against
the live controller and both test routers.** No router package was installed and
no router configuration changed: both live plans were empty. The controller
database did intentionally migrate and update device capabilities and ownership
state as described below.

**Apply and Un-adopt are now serialized per device.** Two destructive operations
cannot concurrently act on the same router or its ownership ledger, while an
operation on another device remains independently admissible. After waiting,
Apply reloads the device row and verifies its stable MAC, so an un-adopt followed
by SQLite ID reuse cannot apply the stale device's plan to its replacement.
Un-adopt waits before reading the device and ownership ledger, so cleanup uses
the ledger written by a preceding Apply rather than an earlier snapshot. Focused
tests cover same-device serialization without fleet-wide blocking, cancellation
and gate cleanup, stale-ID refusal, queued Apply participation in the global
drain, and Un-adopt reading the final ownership ledger.

**SSH bootstrap failures no longer turn malformed verification output into a
panic or an error message into a secret channel.** Empty or whitespace-only
`sha256sum` output now returns an explicit missing-digest error rather than
indexing a nonexistent token; a different digest remains a verification error.
SSH errors carry a fixed operation label, redact the remote command and known
secret values, and withhold remote output for commands that contain a secret.
Regression tests exercise missing, malformed and correct digest output plus
command/verifier redaction, including a remote shell echoing the command.

**The live controller at `127.0.0.1:8080` was backed up before migration.** Its
database passed the integrity check and migrated from schema 9 to schema 10. A
matched v9 binary-and-database recovery pair remains available; the current v10
binary is active on the migrated database.

**Direct live `dryrun` and `applyone` checks were safe on both actual routers.**
Each plan contained 0 operations and 0 prunes; the resulting outcomes were
`applied`/`already matches`, and the controller's owned-section ledger was
repaired. Both routers finished with 0 pending UCI changes and `dnsmasq`
running. Thus the controller state changed as intended, but router configuration
did not.

**The live UI matched the direct checks.** Dashboard showed 2/2 devices.
Settings displayed the legacy DHCP defaults, while the invalid 250–399 pool
kept Save blocked. Preview checked both devices, reported 0 changes and kept
Apply disabled. Un-adopt named the two owned sections and kept both destructive
buttons disabled before confirmation. Discovery swept 508 addresses in 4.8
seconds and found both OpenWrt routers. A live C6 re-probe changed its capability
class from `?` to `C` and detected FDB and switch statistics.

That re-probe also exposed a real UI freshness defect: the fleet row stayed
stale after the device itself had been refreshed. Devices now invokes its parent
refresh after both re-probe and rename, with a regression test for the row
update. At that checkpoint the suite was **123/123 UI tests** and the rebuilt
`index-AjCJjbJV.js` asset was served by the live controller; §5bf supersedes it
with `index-Bzhc0Wqf.js`. The earlier isolated localhost smoke is superseded by
this pass, but still supplies the
custom-DHCP save/reload and clean-console checks. The empty-fleet preview also
continues to say there are no adopted devices to compare or apply rather than
calling an empty fleet converged.

**The full verification gates are green:** the 123 UI tests, production UI
build and dependency audit, `go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, the full
`go test -race ./...`, the working-tree secret scan, JSON validation,
`go mod tidy` consistency, Linux amd64/arm64 builds and Python syntax checks.

**Two narrower DHCP diagnostics remain in addition to the live gateway proof
in §5ba.** Seeing `dnsmasq` running establishes current process health, but an
empty plan cannot prove custom-pool application and lease allocation. An
upgraded legacy network on a small subnet can also inherit the historical
`100`/`150` default that no longer fits; it needs a specific, actionable upgrade
diagnostic and correction path.

---

### 5bc. Explicit device functions, inspect-before-adopt and the clean two-router cycle

**Implemented and exercised end to end on 2026-08-18.** This supersedes §5bb's
then-current schema-10 statement. A device no longer has
to fit one bundled role. Schema 11 adds `devices.functions_json`, while keeping
`role` as the deterministic primary label for older clients. The migration
preserves the old meaning exactly: `gateway` becomes Gateway + AP + Switch,
`ap` becomes AP + Switch, and `switch` remains Switch. A new request can instead
select any non-empty combination of `gateway`, `ap` and `switch`. Only an
omitted functions field invokes legacy expansion; explicit `null`, `[]`, an
unknown value, or corrupt stored JSON fails closed and cannot silently turn a
Gateway-only device into a broadcaster or switch.

**Adoption now has a read-only inspection step before bootstrap.** Authenticated
`POST /api/v1/devices/inspect` uses ubus only: it opens no SSH connection,
installs no login or ACL, writes no UCI, and creates no inventory row. It returns
the measured board/radio/port facts, supported/recommended/unknown functions,
and the exact gateway evidence. A Gateway recommendation requires either an
active IPv4 default route on the active WAN interface (including a custom
interface whose runtime device matches the board WAN port) or enabled LAN DHCP.
An AP's ordinary management default route over LAN is deliberately not gateway
evidence. The C6 defect found live—showing a Gateway badge as if gateway use had
been observed—was corrected: a WAN-capable device may say **Gateway available**,
while only the two strong runtime signals say recommended/observed.

Switch capability is equally explicit rather than aspirational:
`dsa-conditional` means the ports are DSA-capable but managed VLAN carriage
still requires an already VLAN-aware bridge; `observe-only` means legacy
swconfig link/VLAN/ARL/MIB visibility with no controller VLAN writes; `unknown`
does not invent per-port control. Selecting Switch records wired participation
and port visibility. AP and Gateway functions still receive the minimum shared
L2 bridge plumbing their traffic needs because the controller cannot safely
infer a selective uplink port.

**Gateway admission is serialized before touching a router.** The inventory
check, uniqueness decision, SSH/ACL/login bootstrap and device-row commit share
one adoption slot. Consequently two concurrent Gateway adoptions cannot both
pass a preflight and leave a controller footprint on the loser. Only one
managed Gateway is allowed until HA exists. This is not a gateway-first rule:
an empty fleet may adopt an AP-only or AP + Switch device when routing is
managed elsewhere.

**Un-adopt now proves the configuration hand-back before removing its own way
back in.** A missing controller session with owned sections, a failed delete,
or a commit whose success cannot be proved leaves `config_revert_complete=false`,
retains the inventory/ownership record, and skips login/ACL removal. Only a
proved config phase plus a removed footprint deletes the row normally; explicit
Force remains the separately reported escape hatch for hardware that is gone.

The complete live cycle used the real controller and both disposable routers,
with no package installed:

| Stage | WRT3200ACM | Archer C6 v2 |
|---|---|---|
| clean un-adopt | ran second; exactly 2 WLAN sections reverted; config phase complete; login and ACL gone | ran first; exactly 2 WLAN sections reverted; config phase complete; login and ACL gone |
| read-only inspection | active WAN default route, LAN DHCP enabled, 4 DSA LAN ports; Gateway + AP + Switch recommended | no active WAN default route, `dhcp.lan.ignore=1`, WAN down; AP + Switch recommended; legacy swconfig observe-only |
| adoption | first device, Gateway + AP + Switch | second device, AP + Switch |
| site membership/apply | re-added to `all-aps`; exactly 2 WLAN creates | re-added to `all-aps`; exactly 2 WLAN creates |
| steady state | 0 changes; both radios broadcasting | 0 changes; both radios broadcasting |

The final controller view was 2/2 online. The WRT retained its default route via
`203.0.113.1`, LAN DHCP `100`/`150`/`12h`, firewall hash and flat bridge membership
for `lan1`–`lan4`. The C6 retained disabled LAN DHCP, down WAN and active
read-only swconfig links. Both routers had 0 pending UCI changes. The controller
database at this checkpoint ended at schema 11 with 2 devices, 4 owned WLAN
sections and a clean integrity check; the v10→v11 migration was also
integrity-checked.

The final working tree passed `go test ./...`, the full `go test -race ./...`,
`go vet ./...` and `git diff --check`; the aligned UI passed all 135 tests and
its production build. The dependency audit reported 0 vulnerabilities, the
secret scan and `go mod tidy -diff` were clean, tracked JSON validated, and the
controller cross-built for Linux amd64 and arm64.

**The telemetry foreign-key race exposed by that cycle is closed.** Device
removal now fences in-flight collector emissions; lifecycle serialization keeps
ring flush + database write from racing device deletion + in-memory purge;
`ForgetDevice` clears rings, counters, ratio state and uptime state so a reused
numeric device ID cannot inherit its predecessor's telemetry. `WriteRollups`
atomically skips only samples whose parent device is genuinely gone, while an
unrelated database error still aborts the transaction. Focused regressions, the
full suite, race detector and `go vet` passed after the fix.

---

### 5bd. Directional policy, bound fleet apply and the 60-minute class-C gate

**Implemented and verified in the current tree on 2026-08-18.** This section
supersedes §5ay/§5ba's statement that the Zone Matrix was only a target,
§5az's short-run-only budget status, and §5bc's schema-11 endpoint. It does not
claim a live browser Policy Engine pass: that check is still waiting for a
signed-in browser session. No policy was applied to a router for this work.

**Phase 3 now has a real directional policy source of truth.** Schema 12 gives
the existing `zones.policy_json` rows semantic authority. `GET /api/v1/site`
returns one effective record per active managed source as
`{name, forward_to, explicit}`; `POST /api/v1/site/zones/{name}` saves an
explicit `forward_to` array, and `DELETE` resets that source to its legacy
default. A source with no row forwards only to foreign `wan`, exactly matching
the pre-policy renderer. An explicit empty array blocks every modeled
forwarding. Destinations may be another active managed zone or `wan`; `wan` is
destination-only, self-edges are invalid, and reverse initiation is a separate
edge. Thus a direct edge is **Allow All**, an absent direct edge with only the
reverse present is **Allow Return Traffic** through normal conntrack state, and
neither edge is **Block All**.

Names are validated against the identifier firewall4 will actually see:
lowercase/sanitized, at most 11 characters, letter-first, no collision, and no
managed `lan`/`wan` alias. Stored JSON must contain a non-null array of nonblank
strings; malformed data fails the site load/apply instead of becoming an
implicit allow. Saves canonicalize duplicates and ordering. Network and policy
mutations are serialized, and a network edit that would orphan a policy source
or destination is rejected with a repair instruction. An intentional move into
an active target zone remains possible; a target with no explicit row receives
the visible legacy Internet-only default until the operator edits it.

The renderer owns only its own zones and directed `config forwarding`
sections, explicitly normalizes them to enabled/all-family behavior, and never
edits foreign zones, forwardings, rules or redirects. A foreign forwarding or
an active inter-zone `ACCEPT`/`REJECT`/`DROP` rule that makes a matrix claim
unverifiable is a deterministic blocking conflict. So is a foreign DNAT with a
real `dest_ip` from a managed source: OpenWrt ignores `redirect.dest` for DNAT,
so the controller cannot prove the modeled destination. Disabled foreign
sections and router-local redirects do not create false conflicts. Custom
nftables includes remain outside UCI observability; the UI must not claim that
the matrix proves their behavior.

**Preview is now a server-bound write authorization, not a browser snapshot.**
The preview returns an opaque keyed `preview_token` bound to the complete site
intent (including secret-bearing state without exposing it), adopted fleet,
device capabilities/endpoints, ownership ledger and every device plan. Apply
rebuilds that full-fleet preview and compares the token in constant time before
any router write. It then refuses the whole run if any selected device is
unplannable, blocked, stale, traversal-sensitive, caution-bearing or subject to
a radio-death defect without the matching acknowledgment. Scoped API applies
also require `acknowledge_partial_fleet`; the controller UI applies the full
fleet. Immediately before each write, the daemon locks that device and
revalidates the bound device/fleet/site/ledger/plan state. Devices run serially
in dependency order, Gateway last, and the first non-applied outcome aborts all
later devices.

Once admitted, the apply is detached from HTTP cancellation and bounded by one
outer `ApplyDrain` deadline; every device must still have enough time for a full
rollback-confirm cycle before it starts. Shutdown waits for tracked applies
instead of abandoning an armed rollback. Device polling is quiesced at the
apply boundary: `Quiesce` waits for an already-running cycle through its sink
emission, no later poll starts until release, and release wakes an immediate
refresh. A confirmed or already-matching device is reported as applied only
after its ownership ledger is recorded. If that controller write fails, the
response and audit say that the **device applied but controller ownership
recording failed**, and the remaining fleet is untouched.

**Hostname and stale-route recovery are closed too.** Inspect/adopt resolves an
operator hostname exactly once and pins that address across the complete
HTTP→SSH→HTTP workflow, including strict embedded-port and IPv6 handling. Plain
HTTP inventory stores the resolved address because it has no peer-identity pin;
HTTPS may retain the hostname only with the observed certificate pin. For an
already adopted device, the first hard poll failure closes the keep-alive
transport while retaining the rpcd session, forcing the next poll to redial on
the host's current route without turning one transient failure into a login
storm.

**The exact 60-minute class-C release gate passed on the Archer C6 v2.** It ran
30 minutes idle and 30 focused, installed no package and performed no router
write:

| Phase | Cadence and requests | Whole-device observation |
|---|---|---|
| idle | 1.00 polls/min, 1.00 successful/min; 31 raw requests in 30 min = 1.03/min, including one non-poll login | 3.34% CPU; RAM +2208 KiB |
| focused | 5.97 polls/min; 179 raw requests | 4.31% CPU; RAM +716 KiB |

Across both phases, 209 poll batches completed with **0 failed**; the one login
makes 210 raw HTTP requests. Bytes out were **297,321**. All endpoint flash
snapshots and cumulative block-device write counters were unchanged. Direct
postcheck found no pending UCI changes, overlay usage still **416/6976 KiB
(used/total)**, `dnsmasq` running, both radios up, and `dhcp.lan.ignore=1`.

The read-only gate also left its source controller untouched: the logical
database and keyring hashes matched their pre-run backups. The current daemon
then migrated schema 11→12 while retaining 2 devices, their function sets, 4
ownership-ledger rows and 2 group memberships. The schema boundary was proved
with a **consistent SQLite `.backup`**: it contained
`MAX(schema_version)=12`, passed `integrity_check`, and a v11 binary exited 1
with `database is at schema v12 but this build understands v11 — refusing to
downgrade`. An earlier copy of only the live main DB while WAL was active looked
like v11; that was an inconsistent backup artifact, not a downgrade failure.
Never copy a live SQLite main file alone—use `.backup` or a clean
shutdown/checkpoint.

Final gates: `go test ./...`, race-enabled tests for the affected packages,
`go vet ./...`, all **155/155** UI tests and the production build, repository
secret scan, `go mod tidy -diff`, and `git diff --check` all passed.

**Gaps at this checkpoint, with their current disposition:**

- Durable operation recovery is closed in §5be, including a browser reload
  during a real failed/reverted run.
- Explicit policy now fails closed on active foreign firewall includes,
  reachable non-fw4 nftables policy and unreadable/malformed runtime rulesets.
- §5be closes the VLAN/DHCP/network-zone hardware path and directional WAN
  enforcement. Full client-isolation/no-LAN proof remains open.
- §5be closes runtime custom-DHCP health and off/custom lease proof. The model
  also exposes an actionable `legacy_default` blocker when `100`/`150` cannot
  fit, cleared only by explicit customization or disabling DHCP.
- The signed-in Policy Engine browser pass is closed in §5be. Object Manager
  and policy types beyond whole-zone forwarding remain open.

---

### 5be. Durable Apply recovery and the live Phase-3 gateway proof

**Implemented and exercised through the signed-in browser against both lab
routers on 2026-08-19.** No router package was installed, removed or upgraded.
This section supersedes §5bd's open durable-operation, live-browser,
VLAN/DHCP/firewall-LIST and runtime custom-DHCP proof statements. It does not
claim that the temporary test state has been cleaned up or that the complete
guest-isolation milestone is finished.

**The first live Apply failed safely and found a real ACL defect.** Operation
`2a0552f3-f901-4bb1-96a5-8c2ba2de773e` reached the WRT after the C6 correctly
completed as an already-matching no-op. `service.list` reported dnsmasq's
runtime file as `/var/etc/dnsmasq.conf.cfg01411c`, but that path resolves to
`/tmp/etc/dnsmasq.conf.cfg01411c`. rpcd first authorizes the requested path and
then re-authorizes its canonical target, so the existing read-only
`/var/etc/dnsmasq.conf.*` grant was insufficient. The independent DHCP health
check received `PERMISSION_DENIED`, withheld confirmation and the WRT reverted.

The rollback was exact: all seven planned VLAN/DHCP/firewall sections were
absent again, the runtime test interface was gone, the ownership ledger gained
no stale rows and `uci changes` was empty. The ACL now grants read-only access
to both `/var/etc/dnsmasq.conf.*` and `/tmp/etc/dnsmasq.conf.*`; tests require
both grants and reject write access. Reloading Settings while the failed run
was in progress recovered the same durable operation and its per-device
receipt, proving that a lost HTTP response no longer forces a blind retry.

**The corrected fleet Apply then completed.** Operation
`fa6bb976-1ca8-4c73-8de8-64b308b27746` recorded the C6 as already matching with
zero changes and the WRT as applied with these seven owned creates:

- `network.oowrt_bv2` and `network.oowrt_net_testvlan`;
- `dhcp.oowrt_dhcp_testvlan`;
- `firewall.oowrt_zone_lan2` and `firewall.oowrt_fwd_lan2_wan`;
- `firewall.oowrt_in_lan2_dhcp` and `firewall.oowrt_in_lan2_dns`.

On the WRT, the operator-owned management conversion had already moved `lan`
to `br-lan.1`. The controller's VLAN 2 bridge entry then produced a local
`br-lan.2` endpoint with the physical LAN ports tagged, a static
`198.51.100.1/24` interface, a live dnsmasq range and the owned firewall4 zone.
Runtime nftables inspection proved closed input/forward base policy, exact
interface dispatch, DHCP UDP 68→67, separate TCP and UDP DNS accepts, the
modeled `lan2`→`wan` forwarding edge and reject fall-through. This is the
hardware proof of the bridge-VLAN, static-interface, configurable-DHCP and
multi-network firewall-zone LIST path. The legacy-swconfig C6 emitted none of
it, exactly as its `observe-only` capability promises.

**A real client carried traffic through the result.** Temporary WLAN Apply
`a57fc35e-848e-4913-88c5-4acdd68a587c` published the VLAN2 SSID on the capable
WRT only; Preview and the durable result truthfully explained the C6 omission
instead of treating it as failed hardware. A Mac associated to that WLAN,
received a VLAN2 lease, resolved DNS through `198.51.100.1` and reached the WAN
through the WRT. The controller remained reachable over the separate wired
`en9` path throughout.

The signed-in Policy Engine pass then changed live behavior, not only UCI.
Operation `2ef36d6f-b264-4601-9a04-81912f274189` explicitly blocked
`lan2`→`wan`: the client retained DHCP and controller-provided DNS while its WAN
probe stopped. Operation `05726097-4a93-4cc2-9b9c-f9093b6c3393` restored an
explicit allow and WAN access returned. That proves the directional forwarding
subset and its service-rule exception on actual firewall4/nftables state.

DHCP's off/custom paths were also measured at runtime. Operation
`f1f05e40-c43a-49e7-a37a-4784c4c6049c` disabled the test network's server and
the range disappeared from the running dnsmasq configuration. Re-enabling it
with start `50`, limit `10` and lease `1h` produced the exact
`198.51.100.50`–`198.51.100.59` pool; the Mac received `198.51.100.54` with an
exact 3600-second lease. This closes both §5bd DHCP runtime gaps: the health
check observes the real service file, and non-default pool/lease plus
disable/re-enable behavior are hardware-proven.

**At the §5be checkpoint, the lab was intentionally not back at baseline.** Its
applied proof state included the temporary WLAN, `50`–`59`/`1h` pool and explicit
`lan2`→`wan` allow. Cleanup, deletion of the temporary WLAN and final
no-change/UCI-clean proof were pending action-time user confirmation. macOS also
failed to rejoin the saved `Management` Wi-Fi automatically; wired `en9`
remained healthy, so this was not a controller-path loss but had to be resolved
during cleanup. This
paragraph is the §5be checkpoint; §5bg records the later confirmed cleanup and
supersedes its pending state.

The same browser sweep found three presentation defects that are not part of
the router proof. Dashboard reported zero clients while Client Devices and
device detail each showed the same one wireless client; Logs' error filter
counted one match while two rows remained visible; and a 508-address discovery
sweep (4.8 seconds, three answers, two OpenWrt, both already known) falsely
labeled the C6 `gateway · DHCP server` from object existence despite
`dhcp.lan.ignore=1` and its AP + Switch selection. Dashboard, Logs and Discovery
were subsequently fixed and regression-tested. §5bf records their signed-in
live reconciliation under the rebuilt schema-14 daemon.

Full source gates at this checkpoint included **161/161** UI tests, the
production UI build, Go tests/race checks/vet and Markdown diff validation;
§5bf records the later migration/browser proof.

---

### 5bf. Live schema-14 secret migration and rebuilt UI reconciliation

**Completed on the controller host on 2026-08-19 without changing either
router.** The schema-13 daemon stopped cleanly at 04:03:08 after its final
telemetry log reported `flushed=104`. Before migration, the stopped recovery
pair was copied mode 0600 and verified as schema 13 with `integrity_check=ok`:

- `.run/oonfeewrt.db.v13-pre-v14-live-20260819-0403` — SHA-256
  `3e4ea06fbde340c110f3b1357b6c081db0b9b679db2da3ac11d2ae7545289b53`;
- `.run/keyring.json.v13-pre-v14-live-20260819-0403` — SHA-256
  `691e6302779c1ed4fc8995990757b17836691b039f3778f8298ad5705de62aaf`.

At this checkpoint that pair was intentionally retained and
plaintext-sensitive; successful migration alone did not authorize deleting it.
§5bg records the later explicit approval and removal.

**A copy-only rehearsal ran first.** Under
`.run/schema14-rehearsal-a4hxiu`, copies—not the live store—migrated to schema
14, returned HTTP 200 for health and generated zero router traffic. The
rehearsal passed integrity, recorded `scrub_complete=1`, sealed 2/2 WLAN keys and
12/12 ownership verifiers, found zero legacy-value byte hits, reopened with the
matching keyring and loaded a valid site. Only after that result was the live
binary promoted.

The then-promoted `.run/oonfeewrtd-v14-final` identified itself as
`dev-schema14-secretseal-live`, was mode 0700, and had SHA-256
`6b2304d6f398196a091011b9167ce4739a2ed87ac1460540bf7dc12e093564cb`.
At the proof point it was PID 21367 and listening only on
`127.0.0.1:8080`; §5bg records the later post-cleanup replacement.

**The live migration completed and physically scrubbed legacy values before
serving.** SQLite reported schema 14, `integrity_check=ok`, WAL journal mode and
`secret_state` rows/key-check-present/scrub-complete = `1|1|1`. The
structural counts were:

| Record | Total | Legacy plaintext | Ciphertext |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| WLAN keys | 2 | 0 keys in `security_json` | 2 |
| Mesh keys | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Ownership verifiers | 12 | 0 | 12 |

The live `keyring.json` hash remained
`691e6302779c1ed4fc8995990757b17836691b039f3778f8298ad5705de62aaf`.
A verifier loaded the 12 unique legacy values from the stopped copy without
printing them, then scanned the migrated main database, WAL and SHM bytewise:
`legacy_values=12 total_hits=0 main_hits=0 wal_hits=0 shm_hits=0`.

**Controller intent and routers stayed converged.** Passphrase-authenticated
`dryrun` loaded 2 networks, 2 WLANs and 1 AP group. The WRT rendered 10 sections
with 0 plan operations and 0 prunes. The C6 rendered 2 sections with 0 operations
and 0 prunes, plus the expected VLAN2/WLAN capability omission. Direct read-only
ubus inspection found 0 pending UCI changes on both routers. Migration itself
sent no router writes.

**The rebuilt signed-in browser served `index-Bzhc0Wqf.js` and reconciled the
three presentation defects from §5be.** Evidence under that asset:

- Dashboard: devices 2/2, wireless clients 1, LAN clients 8;
- Client Devices: local 8, online 8, wireless 1;
- Logs: 208 total; the error facet said `Events (1)` and exactly one row was
  visible;
- Discovery: 508 addresses scanned, 3 answered and 2 were OpenWrt; capability
  copy used the truthful generic `WAN interface` / `DHCP service` wording;
- Settings loaded both WLANs; the passphrase editor opened blank/write-only and
  was closed without Save;
- Preview showed 2 devices and 0 changes, with the C6 as AP + Switch and WRT as
  Gateway + AP + Switch;
- Policy Engine loaded. Zone Matrix showed explicit `lan2`,
  `lan2`→Internet/WAN as Allow All, Internet/WAN→`lan2` as read-only Allow Return
  Traffic, and Master Table origin `lan2: explicit`.

No policy cell was toggled, no Review/Apply ran, and no setting was saved during
this verification.

**A sealed recovery pair existed at the §5bf checkpoint too.** The online SQLite
backup left the live process untouched and produced:

- `.run/oonfeewrt.db.v14-post-live-20260819-040818` — 462848 bytes, mode 0600,
  SHA-256 `381e46ad0cea45889bd9292a3b91a9cf495314ea855bbd889e64496eee262fc7`;
- `.run/keyring.json.v14-post-live-20260819-040818` — 275 bytes, mode 0600,
  SHA-256 `691e6302779c1ed4fc8995990757b17836691b039f3778f8298ad5705de62aaf`.

The pair independently passed schema/integrity/secret-state and the same
2-WLAN/12-ownership sealed counts, then reopened read-only with its matching
passphrase/keyring. Its main database is self-contained; that verification
created a zero-byte WAL and 32768-byte SHM sidecar, both mode 0600. §5bg records
the later approved removal of this superseded pair and its replacement with the
post-cleanup recovery pair.

**Cleanup was deliberately not claimed at the §5bf checkpoint.** The temporary
`oonfee-vlan2-test` WLAN, the custom `50`–`59`/`1h` DHCP state and explicit
`lan2`→`wan` policy still required a confirmed cleanup Apply. The wireless key
previously disclosed during testing still required confirmed rotation. The
plaintext-sensitive pre-v14 pair was not to be deleted until the operator
explicitly approved retirement. macOS previously failed to rejoin the saved
`Management` Wi-Fi automatically; wired `en9` remains the safe controller path
during those actions. This is the §5bf checkpoint, not current state; §5bg
records the later confirmation and completed actions.

---

### 5bg. Confirmed lab cleanup, WLAN-key rotation and recovery retirement

**Completed on 2026-08-19 after explicit operator confirmation.** The cleanup
kept the intended `testvlan` network—VLAN 2, `198.51.100.1/24` and zone `lan2`—but
deleted the proof-only `oonfee-vlan2-test` WLAN. Its DHCP policy returned from
start `50`, limit `10`, lease `1h` to the legacy intended start `100`, limit
`150`, lease `12h`, yielding `198.51.100.100`–`198.51.100.249`. The explicit
`lan2` policy row was reset; its effective behavior remains the inherited legacy
default of forwarding to `wan`, now truthfully reported as `explicit=false`.
The resulting desired site is 2 networks, 1 WLAN and 1 AP group.

The `example-managed-wlan` passphrase was replaced with a generated 32-character
hexadecimal value. The value is not printed here or stored in the repository;
the operator recovery copy is in macOS Keychain service
`com.oonfeewrt.wlan.example-managed-wlan`. The bound Preview contained exactly six
changes: two managed-BSS key updates on the C6, and on the WRT one DHCP update,
two managed-BSS key updates and removal of the temporary BSS. Operation
`d93695b8-1b31-4550-936a-320dd1cf1bc6` completed with both devices `applied`.
The next browser Preview and passphrase-authenticated `dryrun` each reported zero
changes.

**The live result was checked at every boundary.** Secret-safe comparisons found
the configured key on all four managed BSSes matched desired state without
revealing it. Both routers had two radios and two managed BSSes up; no temporary
BSS remained. The WRT retained all seven intended `testvlan` sections from
§5be, while the legacy-swconfig C6 retained zero VLAN2 sections. Runtime dnsmasq
showed the management and `testvlan` servers, with the latter at
`198.51.100.100`–`198.51.100.249`/`12h`. Both routers had zero pending UCI changes,
and the controller showed 2/2 devices polling and healthy.

A Mac then joined `example-managed-wlan`, received `192.0.2.235`, selected `en0` for
the route, completed one gateway ping, had DNS and received HTTP 200 from a WAN
probe. Wi-Fi was turned off after that proof and the route returned to wired
`en9`, avoiding the known duplicate-`192.0.2.0/24` host-route trap.

The live controller remained schema 14 with one WLAN row, one WLAN ciphertext
and zero legacy/plaintext key fields. Bytewise checks found zero plaintext,
legacy-secret or WLAN-key hits in the database files. The initial explicitly
approved controller-artifact retirement removed exactly 56 legacy artifacts and
four directories; the post-pass inventory found zero schema-before-14
controller databases in the inspected workspace.

**The router recovery archives were replaced too.** A follow-up content check
found that all four retained plaintext `.tgz` files contained the disclosed old
WLAN key. Those four files and the two temporary plaintext tar streams used to
make their replacements were deleted. The final inventory found zero plaintext
`.tgz` files, and both routers had zero pending UCI changes before and after the
backup work. The current mode-0600 recovery archives are:

- `.run/wrt3200acm-post-rotation-20260819.tgz.gpg` — 6146 bytes, SHA-256
  `b25fa380655ba5515d83fd4128a483a208826efd9cf04c02a048030efc37c29b`;
- `.run/archer-c6-post-rotation-20260819.tgz.gpg` — 6261 bytes, SHA-256
  `a71bd3b24e30191e7d78e91f92ad35db9326cec8afef797159602dff4e620874`.

GPG created both with AES256 in batch/loopback mode using the mode-0600
controller passphrase file. Streaming decryption directly into tar inspection
verified exact current configuration and ACL content, two base BSSes per router,
the current WLAN key and no old key, and the current rpcd verifier and ACL. The
archives contain no shadow file and no private, host or uhttpd key. They remain
sensitive recovery material: their confidentiality now depends on the controller
passphrase and the GPG recovery path. Deleting the plaintext copies is not a
claim of forensic erasure; APFS, snapshots and external backups may retain old
blocks or copies.

**A new post-cleanup recovery pair supersedes the earlier v14 pair:**

- `.run/oonfeewrt.db.v14-post-cleanup-d93695b8-20260819-043834` — 495616 bytes,
  mode 0600, SHA-256
  `75fe18211824dea82f39aa75cd1b20433651ee9c3eb3a5f6f4fc402d8e27f459`;
- `.run/keyring.json.v14-post-cleanup-d93695b8-20260819-043834` — 275 bytes,
  mode 0600, SHA-256
  `691e6302779c1ed4fc8995990757b17836691b039f3778f8298ad5705de62aaf`.

The exact pair passed schema-14, integrity, scrub, key-check, operation-receipt
and matching-key read-only reopen checks. Verification-created zero-byte WAL and
32768-byte SHM sidecars were validated and then removed; the recovery database
main is self-contained. The superseded v14 recovery database/keyring and its
sidecars were removed. The only controller database mains left under `.run` are
the active schema-14 store and this recovery copy. Final controller health was
HTTP 200.

The final source gate also passed after the store checkpoint-race fix added a
bounded one-second SQLite busy retry: a 500-iteration stress run, the focused
regression, race checks, the full store suite, `go vet` and the full Go suite were
all green.

**That tested build is now the running daemon.** The prior process stopped
cleanly at 04:52:10 after its final telemetry flush reported `flushed=96`.
`.run/oonfeewrtd-v14-post-cleanup`, version
`dev-schema14-post-cleanup-racefix`, is mode 0700 with SHA-256
`09c539d399044bf8a2054ffaf5293534613bdec220861586c1b4006b85375f87`.
It started at 04:52:14 as PID 26519, opened the schema-14 store and matching
keyring, loaded `devices=2 skipped=0`, bound only `127.0.0.1:8080` and returned
healthy. A post-restart `dryrun` rendered 9 WRT sections and 2 C6 sections with
zero operations and zero prunes. Browser reload returned Sign In, as expected
because sessions live only in process memory; no credential was guessed or
reset.

---

### 5bh. Schema-15/16 source-closure checkpoint (2026-08-19)

**Source checkpoint only, 2026-08-19.** This section does not supersede or
extend §5be–§5bg's hardware evidence. The repository now targets schema 16; the
lab store has not yet been promoted to that schema and Phase-4 has not yet had
signed-in browser/router validation. Do not cite green source tests as proof
that a live router produced these records.

The schema epochs are deliberately separate:

- **14** remains the one-time secret-sealing/key-check/scrub boundary;
- **15** makes the existing firewall-rule and client-policy storage a semantic
  compatibility boundary. The current Master Table includes directional zones,
  explicit IPv4 firewall rules, port forwards, static routes and client block,
  fixed-IP and group desired state. The partial Object Manager compiles
  unsaved/unapplied IPv4 `Secure` reject drafts for client/group/network
  objects and static routes for network objects. Device/group policy routing,
  QoS and application outcomes return explicit gates;
- **16** attests the complete producer-provenance event shape, per-device/source
  ingest cursors with durable continuity-gap timestamps, topology validity
  intervals/source state and explicit RF-scan tables/indexes/foreign keys. A
  colliding partial schema is refused before the version marker can make
  downgrade unsafe.

**Telemetry and client truth.** Raw poll samples remain in the in-memory ring;
SQLite holds completed 5-minute and hourly rollups only. Client Observability
returns one joined response with complete 5-minute buckets for ranges through
7 days and complete hourly buckets beyond, never a partial edge bucket labelled
complete. The request range is at most 31 days. Each metric names its source,
expected/observed counts, half-open gaps and available/partial/unavailable
state. `wifi-v1` is fixed:

`0.45 × RSSI score + 0.35 × (100 − retry delta %) + 0.20 × (100 − TX-failure delta %)`

where RSSI score maps −90 dBm→0 and −50 dBm→100. It is all-or-null: the three
inputs must coexist in one valid station observation and weights are never
renormalized. Cross-device or multi-BSS evidence that cannot identify one AP
leaves AP attribution null. Exact client/path events are capped at 2,000; path
inputs at 10,000 intervals; enumeration at 64 paths/2,048 visits. Historical
router-log and topology-source coverage is explicitly unavailable.

**WAN truth.** Site-health latency, loss and up/down series have exactly one
producer: an adopted Gateway runs stock `/bin/ping` once per minute, three
packets, against fixed target `1.1.1.1`. Zero replies is measured 100% ICMP
loss; ACL refusal, timeout or malformed/incomplete output is unavailable. This
is not an HTTP/DNS check, configurable target list or claim of ISP uptime.

**Events and Logs.** OpenWrt `log.read` is polled once/minute. The decoder caps
one page at 4,096 rows and each message at 4,096 bytes. Producer identity is
`device + source + source_boot + source_id`; cursor continuity follows logd's
u32 IDs, not router wall time. Exact `source_time_ms` remains in event detail,
while the legacy query timestamp is whole seconds and REST pages are stably
ordered by `(ts,id)`. A clock regression is marked and resets association
correlation rather than silently rewriting producer order. The cursor and
events advance atomically; restart, ID reuse/wrap, ring loss, an empty ring
after prior rows and retained-window cap pruning become durable explicit gaps
even if the triggering event row is later removed. Secret-shaped
structured fields/messages are redacted before persistence.

Association authority is narrower than log retention. Older-than-current,
same-timestamp conflicting and non-current-AP disconnect rows remain visible as
raw `openwrt.log` evidence with an ignored reason, but do not move the client's
authoritative attachment or synthesize a roam.

General/Audit Logs use REST `(ts,id)` keyset pagination, 1–1,000 rows, exact
detail lookup and whole-store facets. General coverage distinguishes a missing
producer, a successfully observed empty page, >3-minute staleness and a retained
gap over the 24-hour window. Retention is 24 hours plus 50,000 OpenWrt rows per
device and 100,000 globally; controller/audit events have a separate newest
100,000-row cap. The WebSocket has **no event/log topic**.

**Topology.** Stable nodes use inventory/client MAC refs; aliases remain
evidence. FDB, port mapping, neighbors, association, optional LLDP and an actual
gateway default route create measured/inferred/ambiguous half-open intervals.
Role alone never creates Internet. Empty/error/unknown source outcomes are
durable; a failed poll marks the affected device's source state unavailable
instead of preserving false current coverage. Current source state becomes
stale after 31 minutes. Closed intervals and accepted request ranges are 31
days; one response is capped at 10,000 intervals and reports truncation. A
historical response says historical source coverage is unavailable rather than
borrowing current source state.

**Radios.** Stable identity is the UCI `wifi-device` section. Inventory and
`freqlist` refresh on the 15-minute rediscovery cadence and return their own
observation timestamps plus last-known/stale state. Decoders cap 32 radios, 128
interfaces per radio, 512 frequencies, 32 flags and 4,096 scan BSS rows.
Utilization, RX/TX airtime and interference require valid counter deltas and are
capability-gated. Suggested channels require a completed scan no older than 24
hours, non-stale radio state and a channel list no older than 15 minutes.

RF scan is never periodic: the REST request requires
`acknowledge_disruption:true`, proves `iwinfo.scan` capability/current access,
quiesces the collector, times out after 45 seconds and persists completion or
failure. A controller restart closes pending/running scans as failed instead of
resuming device work. The five-minute maintenance transaction retains the
newest terminal scan per `(device_id,radio_key)`, never prunes pending/running
work, and cascades discarded runs' `radio_scan_bss` rows.

**Live channel and ACL evolution.** `/api/v1/live` is authenticated and
same-origin, accepts only reference-counted `device.stats` subscriptions, and
uses a 32-frame drop-on-full connection queue, 10-second frame-write deadline
and 30-second ping. A slow browser cannot block the collector or grow memory.
Radios and Client Observability acquire/release the APs they are actually
showing rather than stacking duplicate focus leases.

Already-adopted routers with an older scoped ACL may explicitly opt in to
`POST /api/v1/devices/{id}/refresh-acl`. The transaction first proves the
stored controller login and inventory MAC, verifies/pins SSH identity, writes
or replaces only the exact controller ACL JSON, invalidates cached
session/access cadences, then proves a fresh controller login, MAC and
capability probe. It installs no package, binary, daemon or service. The
administrator password/private key is request-only and cleared by the UI;
controller login, inventory, ownership and UCI configuration are preserved.
Declining leaves the router unchanged and source gaps explicit.

At this historical checkpoint, the remaining plan was a consistent schema-15
database/keyring backup, schema-16 promotion, a then-proposed router ACL refresh
and a newly signed-in screen pass. §5bi records the completed promotion and
read-only pass, and supersedes the refresh item: the operator declined it, so it
remains an optional oonfeeWRT controller capability installation rather than
mandatory closure.

---

### 5bi. Schema-16 live pass with the router capability extension left off

**Live checkpoint, 2026-08-20.** This section supersedes only §5bh's pending
promotion/validation sentence; it does not expand §5be–§5bg's Phase-3 proof.
The working database is schema 16, and a newly signed-in browser exercised the
current embedded Phase-4 UI. Both routers kept their existing older ACLs. No
access refresh, package installation, RF scan or router write was performed.

The optional oonfeeWRT controller capability installation has a separate,
unchecked prompt. If an operator accepts it, adoption may create one scoped rpcd
login and access refresh installs or replaces exactly
`/usr/share/rpcd/acl.d/oonfeewrt.json`. It unlocks supported topology, radio
channel/scan, OpenWrt log and fixed-target WAN ICMP observations through
OpenWrt's existing rpcd surface; it installs no package, binary, daemon, service
or firmware and does not change UCI. Leaving it unchecked or cancelling leaves
the router exactly as it is. Features needing newer grants must remain explicit
gaps, not become an implicit reason to change the device. The operator declined
the refresh for this pass, so it is not a mandatory Phase-4 closure item.

**Topology.** Current topology rendered four stable nodes and three active
links: the WRT WAN link and two observed client associations. The response was
truthfully Partial. Both routers reported unavailable/error source evidence for
the old ACL's bridge/STP/neighbor/LLDP reads; missing evidence did not become an
empty graph. The 24-hour history rendered four link intervals in an
interval-only view and kept historical coverage unavailable instead of mixing
current source state into the past.

**Radios.** The screen rendered four stable UCI radio identities. Channel lists
were unknown on all four, DFS was unknown, no complete channel plan existed and
unreported metrics remained Unavailable rather than zero. Scan capability was
unavailable, so the UI offered no scan action and none was attempted.

**Logs.** General rendered 63 controller/device/security rows while explicitly
marking router-log coverage missing for both routers. Audit reported 169
matching rows, served 100 on the first keyset page with Next available, and the
labelled detail view rendered exact event provenance/detail. This proves the
REST pagination/detail UI while preserving the missing producer boundary.

**Client Observability.** The signed-in workspace joined client, AP, radio and
path evidence under one cursor. The gateway-vantage ICMP reachability/loss/
latency series to fixed target `1.1.1.1` was unavailable under the retained ACL,
and historical router-log/topology source coverage stayed an explicit gap.
Those are truthful unavailable inputs, not measured zero loss/latency or proof
of general Internet health.

**Object Manager and the Phase-3 boundary.** The live UI selected managed
network `testvlan` and compiled one concrete static-route draft to documentation
space. The draft visibly remained **Not persisted · Not applied**; it was never
saved, Previewed or Applied, so it changed neither desired-state policy rows nor
a router. This closes the live compiler/UI proof only. It does not close the
route Apply/remove/no-op proof, same-BSS/bidirectional isolation, or Phase 3's
literal full client-isolation/no-LAN milestone.

At this signed-in screen checkpoint, the source was complete and live proof was
intentionally partial under the operator's no-router-change boundary. Optional
source expansion remained available, but truthful gap rendering was the
accepted result while it was off. RF scan retention was source-proven—one
newest terminal run per stable radio key, active work preserved, BSS rows
cascaded—but was not hardware-exercised because this pass created no scan rows.
§5bj records the later final runtime, recovery and Phase-4 completion boundary.

---

### 5bj. Phase-4 completion, proof cleanup, final runtime and recovery

**Final checkpoint, 2026-08-20.** This section preserves §5bi as the signed-in
screen evidence and records the work that closes Phase 4 at the operator's
no-router-change boundary. The final audit found no blocker. The full Go suite,
race suite and `go vet ./...` passed; all 200 UI tests, the production UI build,
`git diff --check` and the working-tree secret scan passed.

The final daemon is `.run/oonfeewrtd-v16-phase4-complete`, version
`dev-schema16-phase4-complete`, 21,766,082 bytes, SHA-256
`6572f9dce156cc0839999efb1add4e9731d187a1b4d52120743d91846d692606`.
It was healthy as PID 5034 with `devices=2` and `skipped=0`.

**The remaining safe Phase-3 UCI proof ran and was removed.** The redundant
IPv4 WAN-allow policy `phase4-proof-docnet-allow`, limited to documentation
network `203.0.113.0/24`, was created by operation
`4456d715-7c6f-4b97-ad52-70a4410465af` and removed by
`11a80831-cb73-4f36-ab41-f7a5c78420a1`; both completed with health and confirm.
The temporary guest WLAN was removed by
`bea94bc0-a333-4a69-b319-fe8f68761168`. The final fleet Preview reported zero
changes. The database retained one WLAN, zero firewall rules and 11 owned
sections: nine on the WRT3200ACM and two on the Archer C6.

The guest client supplied one-direction evidence only: DHCP, DNS and WAN
traffic succeeded, while management-subnet and guest-peer access failed. That
does not prove the reverse direction or same-BSS isolation, and no such claim
is made. The proof WLAN is gone.

**The optional router capability stayed off.** Neither live router's ACL was
installed or refreshed. In source, adoption and ACL refresh remain default-off
prompts that describe the added controller functionality, and the server
requires `acknowledge_router_changes:true` before reaching SSH or mutation.
Declining or cancelling sends no capability request and leaves the router and
its explicit topology, router-log, RF and fixed-target ICMP gaps unchanged. No
package, binary, daemon, service or firmware was installed on either router.

Two final RF compatibility/retention gaps are closed in source. The
`iwinfo.freqlist` decoder accepts the string, integer, null and absent `band`
shapes seen across OpenWrt versions, derives band only from MHz, and preserves
independent frequency facts. Maintenance retains exactly the newest terminal
scan per stable `(device_id, radio_key)`, preserves pending/running work and
cascades removed scans' BSS rows.

**The final schema-16 recovery pair is sealed at**
an ignored schema-16 recovery directory. The directory is mode
0700 and contains exactly two mode-0600 files, `oonfeewrt.db` and
`keyring.json`, with SQLite journal mode `DELETE`:

| file | SHA-256 |
|---|---|
| `oonfeewrt.db` | `c8fab0a351212526d5522ad9f61154326b3eb71c23ca7157e1d7360a06040726` |
| `keyring.json` | `691e6302779c1ed4fc8995990757b17836691b039f3778f8298ad5705de62aaf` |

The copy reopened under strict schema 16, passed `integrity_check`, reported
zero foreign-key violations and `scrub_complete=1`, and contained no plaintext
WLAN/mesh secrets or owned-section secret hashes. Passphrase-authenticated
`tools/recoverycheck` reported `devices=2 credentials=2 owned_sections=11
wlans=1 meshes=0`.

Phase 4 is therefore **complete at the explicitly chosen no-router-change
boundary**. Live coverage remains intentionally partial only where the operator
left the optional ACL capability off; those named gaps are the expected result,
not unfinished Phase-4 work.

---

### 5bk. Phase-4 final correction: explicit capability refresh and live truth

**Correcting checkpoint, 2026-08-20.** This section supersedes §5bj's current-
runtime, recovery and no-router-change claims. Sections §5bi and §5bj remain
historical snapshots, but neither is the final state: the operator subsequently
accepted the separately prompted controller-capability refresh on both routers.
The final binary and recovery identifiers below were captured after the last
build and copy-only recovery checks.

**The capability refresh was explicit and bounded.** Audit event
`device.acl_refreshed` records the Linksys WRT3200ACM refresh at 15:16:44 and the
TP-Link Archer C6 refresh at 15:17:03 local time. Each request required the
operator's separate acknowledgment and refreshed only the controller's scoped
rpcd ACL so existing stock OpenWrt methods could supply the added observations.
The path installs no package, binary, daemon, service or firmware and does not
change UCI. No before/after package-inventory hashes were captured around these
refreshes, so this checkpoint **does not claim that the live package inventory
was unchanged**. Adoption and ACL refresh remain default-off on other routers;
declining the prompt leaves the router and its capability gaps unchanged.

No disruption-acknowledged RF scan was run. ACL access becoming available is
not scan consent, and this checkpoint makes no live RF-scan or channel-
recommendation claim.

**The newly available producers were observed.** Subsequent polls persisted
current topology-source states and `openwrt-logd` events from both routers. The
Gateway also produced completed latency, loss and reachability rollups from the
bounded three-packet probe to fixed target `1.1.1.1`. These are ICMP observations
from one gateway vantage, not DNS/HTTP validation, configurable multi-target
monitoring or proof of ISP uptime. LLDP remains unavailable on both devices and
historical topology/log source-coverage snapshots were not retroactively
created, so those gaps remain explicit rather than borrowed from current state.

**Client presence now follows live attachment evidence.** Retained inventory,
stale neighbor rows and a stale station cache no longer keep clients online.
The final signed-in live grid consequently showed 3 online and 15 offline
clients among 18 retained rows, rather than labelling every remembered device
online.
Connection/AP detail is likewise cleared when its evidence is stale.

**Topology now preserves the physical parent.** Current bridge/FDB evidence
attaches the wired Mac client directly to the WRT3200ACM's `lan1` and the Archer C6 to
the WRT3200ACM's `lan3`; it does not turn the C6's aggregate legacy-switch FDB
view into a false intermediate parent for the MacBook. Measured, inferred and
ambiguous links have distinct line treatments, and ambiguous evidence remains
labelled rather than silently promoted. Missing-source warnings are collapsed
to a bounded summary with native expandable detail; the capability prompt is
shown only for an access gap that the explicit refresh can actually add.

**The final Phase-3 boundary remains deliberately literal.** A later
documentation-network route proof was created and removed through durable
controller operations; the final read-only Preview/diff was a
no-op. A subsequent proof put two physical iPhones simultaneously in
authenticated, associated and authorized state on the WRT's same
temporary proof BSS (`phy1-ap1`). They received distinct guest DHCP
leases. With cellular bypasses disabled, each loaded HTTPS from `1.1.1.1` and
`example.com`, proving fixed-IP WAN and DNS-plus-WAN paths, and each failed to
reach a known-live wired-LAN HTTP listener. UCI carried both
`isolate=1` and `bridge_isolate=1`, while the live bridge port reported
`isolated=1` in sysfs.

Both iPhones also reported reciprocal raw Safari failures to the other's guest
IP. Those observations exercise both directions, but a bare peer IP had no
known-live HTTP listener and no positive control established that either target
would answer that exact probe without isolation. They therefore do not close
the literal bidirectional peer data-plane claim. A durable cleanup operation
then removed only the proof WLAN: the WRT
pruned `wireless.oowrt_wlan2_radio1`, the C6 was a zero-change no-op and the
following fleet Preview/dryrun/option diff was zero-change. The separately
operator-created and applied Guest network on VLAN 3 remains intentional site
state; cleanup did not remove it.

**The final embedded-UI replay passed.** After the aggregate-FDB correction,
the final daemon reported 2/2 managed devices online, two wireless clients and
three online LAN clients. Current Topology showed six nodes and five active
links: both associated clients were measured directly under the WRT, the C6
remained under WRT `lan3`, and no client was falsely placed behind the C6's
aggregate `eth0.1` view. Its six coverage issues remained collapsed behind an
expandable summary. Radios reported four stable radios, 4/4 known channel plans
and 74 channels without relabelling restricted channels as DFS; post-restart
rollup values remained truthfully stale until a completed bucket. General Logs
showed 16,186 events and Audit 216 at the checkpoint, with the labelled detail
dialog working. In Client Observability, selecting tied event `#4393` marked
that exact persisted row pressed while preserving the shared timestamp cursor.
The optional capability panel opened with its acknowledgment unchecked and the
install action disabled; cancelling sent no request.

### 5bl. Fresh-start validation and optional LLDP package boundary

**Current checkpoint, 2026-08-22.** Both routers were factory-reset, protected
with distinct administrator passwords, re-adopted through the default-off,
explicitly acknowledged ACL/login payload, and restored to the reviewed
WPA2-only lab WLAN. Default adoption installed one ACL file and one scoped
login, but no package, binary, daemon, service or firmware. The detailed,
sanitized action/evidence log is `docs/FRESH-START-VALIDATION.md`.

Schema 17's separate, default-off LLDP capability was then proved end to end on
both routers. The controller displayed the exact official-feed plan, installed
only `libcap`, `libevent2-7` and `lldpd`, retained the prior disabled/stopped
service baseline, planned and separately applied only the physical-interface
selection (`lan1`–`lan4` on the gateway and `eth0.1` on the AP), and exposed a
read-only diagnostic. Hardened rollback restored and hash-checked the prior UCI
export, removed only that recorded added set, independently re-read the final
package/service state, and returned both devices to their exact stock counts
(174 and 155 packages) with `lldpd` disabled/stopped before deleting each
ledger row. Clean reinstall/configure/diagnostic passes then restored the
optional capability. Un-adoption remains blocked while a rollback record
exists; no generic SSH command, custom feed, firmware or controller-authored
router executable is exposed.

The v37 signed-in screen sweep passed and exposed one controller UI defect:
opening `/topology` directly rendered Dashboard. Route initialization was fixed
and verified in v38. That build also exposed a transient reciprocal LLDP edge at
startup; fleet convergence closed it, but startup briefly showed five links.
V39 first proved the corrected four-link startup; FS-117 retains its exact
intermediate artifact and recovery evidence.

**Final release-candidate checkpoint.** Binary
`.run/oonfeewrtd-fresh-start-transparent-v40`, embedded version
`dev-schema17-fresh-start-transparent-v40`, is 15,312,098 bytes with SHA-256
`9c3a797c1470d8630f42dc77619007370aad553fae00078716a5a5a457c6b4cc`.
It started at 2026-08-22 08:50:48 PDT; PID 39083 reported health `ok`.
`schema_version` contains rows 14, 16 and 17; SQLite integrity and foreign keys
are clean; both LLDP capability ledgers remain present.

The signed-in `/topology` deep link stayed on that route and showed five nodes
and four current links: gateway→Internet `wan`, AP→gateway `lan3`, and wireless
test client→gateway `phy0-ap0` measured; wired test client→gateway `lan2`
ambiguous. No reciprocal gateway→AP edge appeared. After the complete poll,
`hostapd.get_clients` was `observed` for device 1 (gateway) and `empty` for
device 2 (AP). The only remaining current coverage gaps are the two truthful
BusyBox `brctl showmacs` VLAN ambiguities. The LLDP UI reports controller-managed
`lan1`–`lan4` on the gateway and `eth0.1` on the AP.

Every settled release-candidate gate passed: full Go normal and race suites,
`go vet`, module-tidiness, `go mod verify`, all 274 UI tests, production UI
build, bundle budget, diff check, tree and history secret scans, and binary
reproducibility.

The final-RC recovery directory `.run/recovery-schema17-v40-a3VvOj5a` is mode
0700 and contains only mode-0600 `oonfeewrt.db` and `keyring.json`. The database
is 3,198,976 bytes with SHA-256
`950fca2fef80707b1333b7b240dc1b11875929a0c54ba5f0327e126c29e85762`;
the keyring is 275 bytes with SHA-256
`8ee24ba977f355d38b8433ba3112185e8338015927f7f5577828cbc535aaaa80`.
`recoverycheck` passed with
`schema=17 devices=2 credentials=2 owned_sections=4 wlans=1 meshes=0`; its
transient zero-byte WAL and 32,768-byte SHM were removed. Building, restarting,
checking, and creating the recovery pair changed no router state. This v40
evidence was a merge-ready local checkpoint; it is not itself a Git tag or
published release asset.

---

### 5bm. Phase-4.1 Dashboard and controller-speed-test source checkpoint

**Source-only checkpoint at that step, 2026-08-22.** The working source then
expected schema 18; §5bn records the current schema-19 source boundary. The
published `v0.1.0-rc.1`, v40 artifact and live lab database remain schema 17. No
live database migration, controller restart, signed-in browser pass or router
mutation is part of this checkpoint.

`GET /api/v1/dashboard` now selects the newest gateway with durable Internet
route evidence and returns 72 complete five-minute buckets over six hours.
`site_wan_latency_ms`, `site_wan_loss_pct` and `site_wan_up` remain explicitly
the fixed ICMP probe to `1.1.1.1`, not ISP uptime. WAN RX/download and TX/upload
appear only when the route-interface name exactly matches durable interface
series inventory; no alias or likely interface is guessed. Missing buckets are
null, and every metric reports `fresh`, `last_observed` or `unavailable` with an
independent observation time. The Dashboard renders that evidence and preserves
last-good data across refresh errors.

Schema 18 adds durable controller-host speed-test jobs and no device foreign
key. The authenticated API exposes descriptor/history, start, status and cancel.
Before consent the Dashboard shows `Cloudflare`,
`https://speed.cloudflare.com`, method `controller-http-single-stream-v1`,
provenance `controller-host`, an estimated 10 MiB download plus 5 MiB upload,
the 30-second ceiling, provider/public-IP privacy and WAN-saturation warning.
The runner rejects redirects, supports one active job, retains at most 50
terminal rows, records progress and byte counts, distinguishes operator cancel,
audits lifecycle events, and marks interrupted in-flight rows failed on restart.
It has no Fleet/router dependency and makes no router management, API or SSH
call, write or install. It measures download/upload plus idle latency/jitter;
loaded latency/jitter remain null because no simultaneous loaded probe exists.

This checkpoint documents source behavior only. A live schema-18 migration,
external-provider run, signed-in dark/light browser pass and release packaging
remain future evidence; none may be inferred from the schema-17 hardware record.

---

### 5bn. Phase-4.1 schema-19 account-store foundation (historical)

**Source-only checkpoint, 2026-08-22.** The current working source expects schema
19. It retains §5bm's schema-18 Dashboard/WAN/controller-speed-test slice and
adds account storage and mutation invariants. The published `v0.1.0-rc.1`, v40
artifact and live controller database remain schema 17. The live controller must
stay there until an authorized restart; no live migration, restart, signed-in
browser pass, public-provider speed-test run or router mutation is part of this
checkpoint.

Migration 19 adds `role`, `enabled` and `deleted_at` to `admins`. Its canonical
roles are `owner`, `admin`, `operator` and `viewer`; each existing administrator
becomes an enabled owner and keeps its password hash. New usernames use a
1–64-byte ASCII grammar and a unique `username COLLATE NOCASE` index. An ASCII
case collision aborts and rolls back migration rather than selecting an account.
Soft deletion disables authentication, records `deleted_at`, replaces the
password verifier and retains the row so the username remains reserved and
first-run setup cannot reopen.

Disable, demote and delete use conditional writes that count enabled owners
inside the write statement; concurrent attempts cannot remove the last enabled
owner. Bootstrap/create, role/state/delete and password mutations append their
`auth.account_*` audit event in the same transaction, so an audit failure rolls
back the account change. Schema attestation checks the complete column, CHECK
constraint, unique-index and ASCII-NOCASE shape.

This slice intentionally stopped at the store boundary. At that checkpoint there was no multi-account
management REST API or UI, no role-bearing session, and no role-enforcing
middleware for protected REST routes or the live channel. Existing session
invalidation is immediate: logout, password change, REST expiry and `Sweep`
close the affected session's `/live` WebSockets, whose disconnect cleanup
releases every focused poll. Account-session listing/administration has
not landed. Existing setup/login/self-password behavior continues to use the
compatible account row; schema 19 was not yet evidence that least-privilege
authorization was complete. §5bo supersedes that source boundary.

The Dashboard and controller-speed-test source claim remains §5bm's bounded
contract: server-selected WAN evidence, consent bound to the reviewed
deterministic `plan_id`, one active controller-host job, cancellation/history and
no Fleet/router dependency. No request has been made to the public speed-test
provider.

---

### 5bo. Phase-4.1 account/RBAC and diagnostics-log foundation

**Source-only checkpoint, 2026-08-22.** Schema 19 now extends §5bn through the
API and UI. Sessions carry `owner`, `admin`, `operator` or `viewer`; an exhaustive
declarative policy server-authorizes every protected REST route and `/live`.
My Account supports password changes and named in-memory session revocation.
Owner administration supports create, role/state/password changes, soft delete
and target-session revocation. Owner writes require password reauthentication
valid for five minutes and never auto-retry after a prompt.

The store rechecks the enabled owner actor in each `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` mutation,
protects the last enabled owner under concurrency and commits the audit event in
the same transaction. Session revocation closes live sockets and cancels
in-flight requests. Session management identifiers are independent random
values; peer display uses the socket address and ignores forwarded headers.
Login rechecks enabled state, role and password verifier after the expensive
password comparison, so a concurrent disable, role change or reset cannot create
a late session.

A mode-0600 bounded rotating `controller.jsonl` sink now mirrors accepted
structured controller records for diagnostics. At this checkpoint it did not
expose a download or make a router call. §5bp supersedes that diagnostics
boundary. Encrypted portable backup/restore, live schema migration
and signed-in browser proof remain open. The public speed-test provider has not
been contacted.

---

### 5bp. Phase-4.1 stored diagnostics and online-backup foundation

**Source-only checkpoint, 2026-08-22.** The schema-19 source now completes the
stored-evidence Diagnostics surface. Owner/admin can inspect the fixed section,
exclusion, bound and log-gap disclosure; start one cancellable job; view bounded
terminal history; and download a private, checksummed ZIP. The bundle contains
redacted/pseudonymized bounded controller, stored-device, topology/radio/source,
event and rotating-controller-log evidence. Stored mode makes zero router
management/API/SSH calls and zero router changes. There is no live-router
refresh mode.

The controller log input is a private bounded rotating JSONL family. Startup
and shutdown clean only controller-owned diagnostics artifacts; jobs are
cancelled/drained before the store and logger close.

`Store.BackupTo` is the landed online SQLite-snapshot foundation. It captures
committed WAL state, stages mode-0600 output in the destination directory,
refuses overwrite, verifies schema/key state/integrity/foreign keys and removes
partial output on failure or cancellation. It does **not** package the matching
`keyring.json`, encrypt a portable artifact, restore data, or expose backup API
or UI at this historical checkpoint. §5bq supersedes this boundary with the
completed schema-19 source workflow.

The live controller remains schema 17. No live migration, daemon restart,
signed-in browser pass, router call/write/install or public-provider speed test
was performed for this source checkpoint.

---

### 5bq. Phase-4.1 encrypted portable controller backup/restore source closure

**Source-only checkpoint, 2026-08-23.** Schema-19 source now implements the
owner-only portable controller recovery workflow end to end. Export captures a
consistent live-WAL SQLite snapshot and its matching wrapped key material in one
authenticated native `.oowrtbak`, encrypted under a caller-owned export
passphrase separate from the controller runtime passphrase. Backup and restore
routes require TLS or direct loopback. Export start/download and every restore
mutation require recent account-password reauthentication.

Restore accepts only a bounded raw `application/vnd.oonfeewrt.backup` upload
with an exact `Content-Length`. Disposable private staging authenticates the
fixed artifact, proves its manifest schema matches its actual database, rejects
unsupported future schema, migrates a scratch copy to exactly schema 19, and
validates integrity, every sealed secret and a usable owner. The safe preview
contains only manifest identity, source/target schema and recovery counts; its
export passphrase is cleared. Cancellation/error/expiry remove controller-owned
plaintext stages and SQLite sidecars.

Confirmation is bound to the preview's artifact and `plan_id`. It requires the
export passphrase again, the current destination runtime passphrase, exact
`RESTORE CONTROLLER`, and four separate acknowledgements for restart, session
revocation, router-write suppression and no automatic router Apply. The runtime
passphrase is the controller boot/keyring secret, not the signed-in account
password; it is checked against the live keyring/data key before a prepared
pair is created. No passphrase is retained.

Before replacement, the controller writes a mode-0600 encrypted safety artifact
to `<data-dir>/.oonfeewrt-recovery/safety-<restore-id>.oowrtbak` using the same
export passphrase. It is not age-expired. After the applied audit receipt is
durably cleared, fixed-shape retention targets three artifacts, fills available
slots newest-first and prunes the rest. Artifacts referenced by active marker,
receipt or suppression state are always preserved, even if that temporarily
exceeds three. Copy an artifact off-host before pruning when longer retention
is required. The controlled in-process restart quiesces work,
checkpoints/closes SQLite, verifies and swaps the prepared pair,
and rolls back before serving if validation fails. Success revokes all sessions
and persists router-write suppression until an owner recently reauthenticates
and enters exact `RESUME ROUTER WRITES`. Restored desired state is never
automatically applied. Read-only monitoring of restored devices may resume
after restart using restored credentials while the gate remains active.
Explicit resume immediately starts automatic 802.11k neighbour reconciliation,
which may call hostapd `rrm_nr_set`; it does not start a restored
desired-configuration Apply.

The source packages have normal/race/adversarial coverage for artifact
authentication, schema mismatch/future rejection, migration, secret/owner
validation, cancellation, no source/live-pair mutation, residue cleanup,
filesystem/symlink/race defenses, prepared-pair ownership, restart intent and
suppression. This is not live evidence: `v0.1.0-rc.1`, v40 and the lab database
remain schema 17. No live schema-19 migration, signed-in backup/restore browser
pass, controlled live restart, or router restore test has run. Remaining UI
polish and final `v0.1.0` release evidence remain open.

---

### 5br. Phase-4.1 live schema-19 upgrade closure

**Live checkpoint, 2026-08-23.** The controlled controller upgrade and restart
completed. The live runtime reports exact binary version
`dev-phase41-live-schema19` and schema 19. Its verified recovery state contains
two devices, two credentials, one enabled owner, one WLAN and no mesh.

A signed-in live UI smoke passed Dashboard, Accounts, Diagnostics, Backup &
Restore, Devices and Topology with no browser errors. This was a route/render
smoke: it does not claim diagnostics generation/download, backup export,
restore upload/preview/confirmation, a public-provider speed test or router
restore. Fresh schema-17 rollback and schema-19 recovery sets passed
verification.

This remains historical live evidence, not publication state. The completed
`v0.1.0` tag workflow and GitHub Release are authoritative. The release matrix
owns isolated restore/clean-container proof; gateway-run speed testing is
deferred.

---

## 6. Working practices that earned their place

Stated because they repeatedly caught real bugs, including bugs I had already
written and believed.

- **A refused check is not a negative answer.** Denied vs absent must stay
  distinct. Conflating them made `probe.py` report "no DSA" and "legacy
  iptables" for a device that has both, and the same class of bug reappeared
  three times afterwards — twice inside code written to prevent it.
- **Presence-probing cannot detect a field that is present and wrong.** Three
  mwlwifi quirks needed *re-reading* to find. Anything that decides a capability
  from one sample is guessing.
- **Verify with the rawest source available.** Reading "on disk" with `uci get`
  (which overlays a pending delta) produced a confident, wrong finding that was
  committed before being caught.
- **A measurement script that cannot distinguish a failed call from an empty
  result will eventually report a failure as data.** That produced a 131-second
  "divergence" that did not exist.
- **A fixture that cannot express the broken state cannot catch the bug.** The
  adoption bug that stopped every stock router survived because the mock had a
  hardcoded interface list that could not go empty, and no radio-level config at
  all. Two blind spots in the fixture, in the exact shape of the blind spot in
  the code.
- **When a value can come from more than one source, check what decides.** The
  client grid picked an AP by which collector wrote second. Holding the evidence
  fixed and reversing only the write order is what proved it; reading the query
  had not.
- **A watchdog that cries wolf will be ignored on the day it is right.** The WRT
  monitor reported a FAULT for a normal 802.11r roam, and separately reported the
  router UNREACHABLE while it was answering — a false "down" and a false alarm
  are the same failure.
- **Never put a real credential in a test, least of all in the test about
  credentials.** The lab AP's live passphrase went into a public repository
  inside `TestTheTakeoverBriefNeverCarriesThePassphrase`. A sentinel does
  identical work, and the load-bearing assertion was never the constant anyway —
  it was that the response has no field a secret could live in.
- **A guard written from one radio must not be applied to the device.** And the
  obvious per-radio fix is a trap: excluding a radio that has not identified
  itself turns a real warning into silence, which is the cardinal error wearing
  a different hat. Exclude only what is KNOWN to be different.
- **A test that passes while asserting nothing is worse than no test.** Eight of
  these were shipped in three days and every one was caught by mutation testing
  rather than by reading. Revert the fix; if the test still passes, it tests
  nothing. The commonest causes: a fixture value already satisfying the
  assertion, a mock returning undefined so the path never runs, asserting the
  absence of something never present in that fixture, keying a check on a field
  every fixture happens to carry — and **a spy that only records when the test
  depends on the callback's effect**. `onDone` closes a panel; a spy that did
  not close it left the cleanup unrun, so an assertion about double-firing could
  not fail.
- **Follow the value, not the file.** A security guard can be correct, well
  worded and completely unreachable. The SSH host-key refusal was dead in five
  places at once — no column, no field on the result, neither call site passing
  it, no test — and each one reads as a harmless omission unless you already
  know about the other four. Reading a file at a time cannot find this; tracing
  one value from where it is produced to where it is checked can.
- **A confirmation must be re-earned, every time.** Three separate ones this
  session persisted past the thing they confirmed: the forced-removal toggle
  (§5aj), and both acknowledgements on the apply screen (§5ao), where a tick for
  one plan silently enabled a different one. If a screen is careful that stale
  DATA never sits beside an enabled button, it has to be equally careful about
  stale CONSENT.
- **A residue you documented is still a bug.** `rate()` named its own gap —
  "that is the residue, and it is one interval wide" — and the honesty made it
  feel handled. It was reachable at the ordinary poll interval, on both
  reference devices, triggered by the controller's own applies. Writing a
  limitation down is not the same as bounding it; go and check whether the case
  can actually occur.
- **A comment can be dangerous while the code is right.** `expireStale`
  described a design the code does not have. Nothing was broken — until someone
  tidied the code to match, which would have deleted the interface-recreation
  state on every flush. A wrong comment is a trap armed for the next reader.
- **A missing item leaves no gap.** The client total summed the radios that
  answered and called it known, because a refused `get_status` creates no entry
  — the absent radio is invisible and the remainder looks complete. Wherever a
  collection is built by appending on success, its length cannot tell you
  whether it is whole; something has to record that separately, and here it
  already did.
- **Validate what the caller sent, not what you substituted for it.** The
  rename length check ran after the fallbacks, so an empty request came back
  refused for being 120 characters too long. A limit exists to constrain input;
  applying it to a value you derived yourself turns a guard into a dead end.
- **A default nobody can change is a decision, not a default.** The device name
  came from the board model, which is right, and there was no way to edit it —
  fine until a site holds two of the same model. Ask of any default: what does
  someone do when it is wrong?
- **A gap in a table is not automatically a task.** Having isolated one variable
  and not another, the missing cell reads like an invitation. It is not one when
  the answer cannot change the recommendation — and here the cost of filling it
  was a dead radio and somebody walking to the device. Recording "not measured"
  is honest; treating it as a to-do turns a settled answer back into an open
  question and spends hardware to learn nothing.
- **Gate on what the operator asked for, not on how bad it is.** Requiring
  acknowledgement for every radio-death defect would have demanded a tick before
  every apply to the reference device forever, because one of its defects is
  unconditional hardware. The useful line is whether the configuration being
  applied *asks* for it — a hazard you chose, versus one you merely have.
- **Bound a remote call from the client, never with a binary on the device.**
  `timeout 5 ubus call …` printed nothing for both radios and read exactly like
  "the radios are dead" — on a device that had just come back healthy. Busybox
  on that build has no `timeout`, and a missing guard is indistinguishable from
  the hang it was supposed to catch. Use `ssh -o ConnectTimeout` and a local
  watchdog.
- **A current reading is not a history.** "The WRT has carried zero clients"
  came from a live `get_clients` returning an empty list — true at that instant,
  false about the run, and it had held an experiment open as inconclusive for a
  day. The controller's own station telemetry answered it in one query. Before
  claiming something never happened, ask the series that would have recorded it.
- **Two things on one screen that disagree are a finding, not a rendering
  quirk.** A live "74.1% busy" above a chart saying "No data yet", same radio,
  same second, turned out to be two different sources with the panel charting
  the wrong one (§5ak). Whenever the same quantity appears twice, find out
  whether it came from the same place.
- **A correct function wired to nothing passes all its own tests.**
  `fmt.percent` handled tick spacing properly while the chart called it without
  any, so every label still collapsed on screen. Unit-testing the piece proves
  the piece; the bug lives in the composition. Pull the composition out into
  something a test can call, and when a call site genuinely cannot be reached,
  say so in the comment instead of letting green tests imply it is covered.
- **Making something visible is how you find out it was never right.** Three of
  §5ak's defects were in charts that had always been broken and had nothing to
  draw, so nobody could see it. Fixing what data reaches a screen tends to
  produce a second round of findings on the screen itself.
- **An empty state has to name ITS OWN reason.** A shared "no data yet, check
  back in five minutes" is right for a series recorded every poll and actively
  harmful for one recorded only while a panel is open — it sends the reader off
  to do the exact thing that stops the collection.
- **A capability declared at every layer but the last one is the same as one
  that was never built.** `force` had a field, a JSON tag, a documented meaning,
  a comment explaining the ordering that made it work, and a slot in the
  TypeScript request type. No screen sent it, so a device that could not be
  reached could never be removed. It reads as finished from every angle except
  using it — which is the only angle that settles it.
- **Read the screen above whatever you just changed.** Not the code you wrote:
  the surface a person touches to reach it. §5ah added a new way for un-adopt to
  fail, and the panel over it turned out to have no way to recover from any of
  them, including the ones that had always existed.
- **Then DRIVE it, on a throwaway.** Reading the un-adopt panel found two
  defects; running it found two more, and driving the *error* path found the
  three in §5aj. A screen can be right in every state you imagined and wrong in
  the one the flow reaches. Manufacture the failure on a disposable inventory
  row: a closed port for "cannot connect", and `tools/hostilessh` — which
  accepts any password then fails every command — for "connects and can do
  nothing", the half-succeeded case that is hardest to reach and worst to get
  wrong. **Never by feeding a real device a wrong password**, because the
  reference hardware accepts any password when root has none, so the "failure"
  would succeed and un-adopt a working AP.
- **A guard that reports itself as configured is worse than an absent one.**
  The empty-fingerprint case is the whole pattern in miniature: store `""` and
  the column says "pinned", the first-use branch never runs again, and nothing
  anywhere is checking anything. Refuse the empty value at the setter.
- **A fix that opens a path owns what is already on it.** Making forced removal
  reachable from the UI turned a latent handler bug — a failed un-adopt
  discarding the very report the failure produced — into a route an operator can
  walk, and the payload it destroys is irrecoverable because the row it
  described is gone. Ask what a new path leads to, not only whether the path
  itself is right.
- **An error response is not always only an error.** Two endpoints here return a
  result and an error together, and the generic "send the error string" helper
  silently drops the half that matters. Whenever a call can half-succeed, the
  body is part of the answer on the failure path too.
- **Review the fixes, not just the code.** A fix written quickly to close a
  finding is where the next bug is. The second review round found MORE than the
  first, including a fix that committed the exact error it was fixing.
- **Show the items, not the count.** The un-adopt panel was changed to list the
  sections it would revert instead of counting them afterwards, and the list
  immediately exposed two claims for sections that no longer existed. A count
  cannot be wrong in a way anybody notices.
- **Mock-green is not hardware-green.** The mock passed throughout while real
  hardware exposed the shared-session bug that reverted healthy changes.
- **A fix for one defect is not a fix for the next one in the same field.**
  "`iwinfo.survey` reports noise unsigned, so read it from `iwinfo.info`" was
  written up as settled and repeated in four documents. It settles the encoding
  and says nothing about whether the value can be trusted — which, on the 2.4
  GHz radio, it cannot, from either source. The advice was not wrong; it was
  answering a different question than the one a reader would use it for.
- **A component that depends on another having run first has a bug waiting.**
  The live channel's subscriber assumed something else had opened the
  connection. When that assumption broke, the symptom was a panel that silently
  showed nothing while the server pushed correctly — indistinguishable from a
  server fault, and it cost an hour of looking in the wrong place. Making the
  subscriber connect for itself removed the coupling and the whole class of
  confusion.
- **Test against a genuinely clean subject, not a convenient one.** The
  capability probe ran in the wrong order for the entire life of the project and
  every test passed, because a leftover ACL file was always already on disk and
  root's wildcard expanded over it. The bug was reachable only on a device that
  had never been adopted — which is the state every real user starts from, and
  the one no test covered until adoption could actually clean up after itself.
- **A guard that cannot fire is worse than no guard.** The 32-bit wrap check
  was tested against a bound so loose it could only reject readings 1.7 seconds
  apart, while the comment beside it claimed it "bites at the focused rate".
  Both the code and the prose read as protection; neither was. When a bound is
  written down, do the arithmetic on the range of inputs that can actually
  reach it.
- **Run it and look at it.** Four defects in Phase 1 survived a green test
  suite and died within minutes of a browser pointing at the real thing:
  firmware never persisted, client IPs collected and dropped, every page load
  301-ing, and a chart axis labelled with years for data from that afternoon.
  Tests check what you thought to assert; opening the page checks what is
  actually there.
- **A health check can only fail on what it looks at.** The VLAN change passed
  health, landed its confirm, and severed the network. The check asked "is the
  lan interface up" and the interface was up — address intact, state UP, and
  zero neighbours. Liveness of an interface is not connectivity through it, and
  the gap between those two is exactly where a confirmed change can still be
  catastrophic. When a health check gates something irreversible, ask what
  passing it actually proves.
- **Arm the undo before the experiment, not after.** Three times a change took
  the device off the network mid-command, and three times a pre-armed
  `sleep N; restore` running locally on the device brought it back. A recovery
  path that depends on the connection you are about to break is not a recovery
  path. This is also why the apply engine's rollback lives on the device rather
  than in the controller.
- **A mock that is easier to write than the real thing is testing the wrong
  thing.** `internal/reconcile` was mock-verified and green for weeks. Its mock
  returned `map[string]string` because that is the obvious shape for UCI values,
  and the device returns a bool and a number among them — so the very first read
  against hardware failed completely. The mock did not merely miss a bug; it
  encoded a simpler world than the one the code runs in, and every test written
  against it inherited that. Where a mock has to invent a payload shape, get the
  shape from a real capture.
- **Latency is not load.** Four documents described `iwinfo` as "~92% of a
  focused poll" and that number was being used, implicitly, to reason about
  what focused polling costs a device. It is 92% of the poll's *wall time*; in
  CPU a focused poll costs only 1.25× a baseline one, because those calls block
  on the wireless driver instead of burning cycles. The original measurement
  was correct and the inference drawn from it was not. When a figure gets
  reused, check that the quantity it measured is the quantity now being argued
  about.
- **Check whose model a question actually needs.** Client scoping sat in the
  backlog behind "needs the site model, so it is a Phase 3 dependency". The
  reasoning was that telling a LAN from a WAN requires a definition of a LAN —
  true — and the unexamined step was assuming the definition had to be *ours*.
  The device already has one and publishes it in a single call. The item was
  half a day's work sitting behind a phase boundary that did not exist. When a
  dependency is asserted, check which system actually holds the fact.
- **A comment that states a guarantee is a claim, and claims need checking.**
  `Logs.tsx` carried an accurate, well-argued paragraph about why filter counts
  must come from an aggregate rather than the loaded page — sitting directly
  above code that counted the loaded page. The prose was not wrong about the
  principle; it was wrong that the code implemented it. Nothing flags this: it
  reads as documentation of a decision rather than an assertion about
  behaviour. Same failure as the 32-bit wrap guard whose comment claimed it
  "bites at the focused rate". When a comment promises a property, the property
  is a test, not a sentence.
- **A default CSS value is not a fixed value.** `height: 33` on a `<td>` is a
  minimum in table layout; the row came out 33.84px. Virtualization multiplies
  that error by the row index, so it was invisible at the top of the grid and
  most of a screen wrong at the bottom — the worst possible signature, because
  every casual check happens at the top. Anything that gets multiplied by N
  should be measured rather than assumed.
- **A probe is only read-only if it cannot succeed.** ARCHITECTURE specified
  fingerprinting devices with a `session.login` that fails, on the reasoning
  that a failed login reads nothing and writes nothing. The reasoning is sound
  and the probe is not, because it assumes the login fails. On a device with no
  root password it succeeds, and the "read-only" sweep becomes a sweep that
  mints a root session on every passwordless host in the subnet. The design
  error is the same shape as reading a denial as an absence: an operation was
  classified by its *intended* outcome rather than by the outcomes it can
  actually have. The fix — `list`, which has no success case worth having —
  turned out to be cheaper, faster and more informative than the thing it
  replaced, which is usually what happens when the honest version is found.
- **The last thing you did is not the cause.** hostapd on the reference device
  went into uninterruptible sleep with an `rrm_nr_get_own` in flight, and the
  obvious conclusion — a driver quirk in that call, of exactly the shape §5q and
  §5s already document twice — was wrong. The kernel log showed the driver
  already failing before the call, and on a freshly booted device the same call
  returns instantly and leaves hostapd healthy. A project that has found three
  real "the device says yes and means no" quirks is primed to see a fourth
  everywhere; a controlled repeat on a known-good device is cheap and settles
  it. The cost of getting this wrong is not a wasted hour — it is a quirk
  recorded in the capability model, gating a working feature off working
  hardware forever, with a measurement's authority behind it.
- **One component's fixture, checked by another component's expectations.**
  The mock answered ubus `list` with `{}` unless its first parameter looked like
  a session token — backwards, since `list` needs no session and that is exactly
  why discovery uses it. Discovery's own tests use their own fixture, so the
  disagreement was invisible for the life of the project; it surfaced the first
  time a daemon test asked discovery to identify the mock. Not the usual
  mock-is-simpler failure: this mock was *inverted*, and every test that never
  asked the question passed either way. Where two components share a fixture,
  make at least one test cross the boundary.
- **Two sources that answer the same question do not answer it the same way.**
  `iwinfo.devices` and `luci-rpc.getWirelessDevices` both list wireless
  interfaces, and only the second listed a live 802.11s mesh point — measured.
  A feature that read one list and looked up the other's map silently never
  fired. §5o had already chosen getWirelessDevices for modes; the same code
  then used the other list for the same question, two lines apart. When two
  calls overlap, write down which one is authoritative for what.
- **A cache invalidated at the right moment can still be invalidated too
  early.** An apply invalidates the interface list, correctly — and the refetch
  landed in the seconds before the new interface existed, so it cached the
  absence and held it for the full cadence. Invalidation says "this is stale";
  it does not say "the replacement is ready". Where a change takes effect
  asynchronously on the device, the re-read has to be scheduled after it, not
  after the call that requested it. Third appearance of "an apply returning is
  not a radio being ready".
- **Firing an event is not performing a gesture.** Every drag test in the UI
  suite called `fireEvent.dragStart` on a header and asserted the reorder
  landed. They all passed on a grid whose headers were `draggable={false}` —
  a header no mouse could ever pick up — because fireEvent dispatches the event
  whatever the DOM says. The tests proved the *handler* worked and said nothing
  about whether the gesture can begin. Where a feature depends on an attribute
  the browser consults rather than on code you wrote, assert the attribute.
- **A correct value under a wrong label is a wrong readout.** "Packages
  installed: none" was true — the controller installs none, and the field exists
  so that claim can be checked rather than believed — and it read as a statement
  about the device, which for any real router is plainly false. The explanation
  was in a `title` attribute nobody hovers. Two more in the same sitting:
  "Radios" listing BSSes, and one channel's occupancy printed once per BSS so
  that one measurement looked like two. None of the three had a wrong number in
  it, and all three told the reader something untrue.
- **Enumerating the wrong noun makes hardware disappear.** `iwinfo.devices`
  lists broadcasting interfaces; `probeRadios` treated them as radios. A device
  with no WLAN therefore had no radios, so the renderer would not give it a
  WLAN, so it could never have one — and stock OpenWrt ships radios disabled, so
  that was every freshly adopted router. It survived because the one device that
  ever worked had its radios switched on by hand first. When a call answers a
  question, check it is the question being asked.
- **A check that cannot run must not report a clean result.** With no radios to
  inspect, the Marvell mesh quirk could not fire, and mesh flipped from
  correctly-Absent to Present on a driver that will not run a mesh point. The
  three-state rule is usually applied to a call that was refused; this was a
  check whose INPUTS went missing, and it reached the same wrong answer by a
  different road. Where a gate depends on data that can be absent, absence of
  the data is NotObservable, not a pass.
- **A management-plane read is not a measurement of the physical world.** The
  WRT3200ACM beaconed an SSID that existed in no configuration for fourteen
  hours while `/etc/config`, hostapd's running conf, `iwinfo`, ubus AND the
  kernel's `iw dev info` all reported the correct one. Every check this project
  had was on the wrong side of the driver. The consequence was not just a wrong
  reading — it was hours of "verified on hardware" claims about wireless
  behaviour that no radio was performing. Where a property is physical, confirm
  it physically: a scan from a second device costs one command.
- **A topology written down once is a topology that is wrong later.** This file
  described the lab as "cabled LAN-to-LAN, C6 behind the WRT", with the dev Mac
  at an address and interface that had both changed. It also never mentioned
  that the C6's WAN port is plugged into the UniFi network, which makes it
  dual-homed — so every sentence anyone wrote about "what happens when this
  device loses its cable" was reasoning from a diagram that did not match the
  room. Cheap to check (`carrier` under /sys/class/net, one `network.interface
  dump`), and it took an accidental unplug to expose. Re-measure the wiring
  before designing anything that depends on it.
- **A test helper that computes an identity its own way will invent a second
  device.** The seed helpers wrote device MACs as literals while adoption reads
  the LAN bridge, so a seeded row and a real adoption of one physical box
  coexisted as two adopted devices — one AP polled twice against a budget of one
  request a minute. Fixtures that stand in for a real path must call the real
  path's function, not agree with it by hand.
- **Say what a check proves, not what it suggests.** The noise-stability
  detector fires on a disagreement and stays silent on agreement, so silence is
  not evidence. On one hardware run the survey pair agreed while the
  `iwinfo.info` pair jumped 45 dB — same radio, same minute. `Present` therefore
  means "not caught misbehaving", and the code, the docs and the field name all
  say so, because a future reader will otherwise round it to "verified".
- **An option you stop writing is not off — it is whatever you wrote last.**
  A reconciler that compares only the keys it currently writes cannot see a
  setting it has stopped managing. Every conditional write needs an explicit
  false value, or an explicit delete. §5aw: turning 802.11r off produced zero
  operations and the preview said "already matches".
- **Zero findings from a crashed run is not a clean bill of health.** §5aw's
  pre-flight audit returned no findings because all five of its agents died on
  a session limit. Check the failure count before believing a green result —
  an empty result and a passing result look identical.
- **A message that names a problem without naming an action is half a message.**
  §5ax's audit found 24 of them, and the one the operator complained about had
  been written an hour earlier by the same person who had just written this
  rule down. Knowing it is not applying it. Give the action AND an example the
  reader can type; "write it in CIDR form" is not as useful as "for example
  198.51.100.1/24".
- **Check the remedy still works after you change the thing it describes.** Two
  tooltips became false the same morning the code under them changed. A message
  is a claim about behaviour and ages exactly like code, with nothing compiling
  it.
- **When the operator says your fix did not work, believe them before the
  code.** §5ax's re-probe remedy failed twice: the second failure existed only
  because `logReprobe` wrote nothing on an unchanged probe, which no test and no
  reading had caught. It surfaced because someone followed the instruction and
  reported that the screen did not move.
- **Distinguish "I could not reach it" from "it is not there" in DISCOVERY too.**
  Two ethernet adapters on one subnet made the controller unable to route to its
  own fleet; discovery reported `found=0`, and working devices were deleted in
  response. The three-state discipline this project applies to capabilities
  stops at the network layer, and that is where it cost the most.
- **A green suite against a mock proves the mock agrees with you.** §5as–§5au
  fixed nine defects without touching a device. The first run of `tools/dryrun`
  against real hardware found the reference Archer C6 being described back to
  its owner incorrectly — a swconfig board reporting bridge `eth0.1` and no
  taggable ports, which two separate code paths read as "the device did not
  answer". No test here could have caught it, because no mock in the repo knows
  what such a board reports. **Point the real code at the real thing, early.**
- **An empty answer is not always an error status.** Measured against rpcd: a
  missing UCI *option* returns status 0 with an empty body, never NotFound —
  while a missing *config* returns 4 and an ACL refusal returns 6. Any check
  that identifies "absent" by waiting for a non-zero status silently never
  fires. Verify the shape of the negative answer, not just the positive one.
- **A value with a "we do not know" state is only as good as its worst
  consumer.** `capability` guards Denied vs Absent meticulously and encodes the
  rule structurally — and five sites outside it switched on NotObservable alone,
  so Unknown fell through to the Absent branch and told operators their hardware
  lacked features nobody had checked for. The producer being careful is not the
  property that matters. **Check the consumers that DELETE, and the ones that
  emit a sentence a person will act on.**
- **A zero value that means "no" is a bug waiting for the next release.**
  Unknown is State's zero value, capability records are JSON, and a record
  written before a Feature existed has no key for it — so every device adopted
  before a feature was added reads Unknown for it. Any gate treating that as
  Absent breaks on the whole fleet the moment a feature is added. When a type's
  zero value means "nothing recorded", no branch may treat it as an answer.
- **A test that never reached its subject looks exactly like one that passed.**
  Two ownership tests in §5at passed without executing a line of the code under
  review: the package's mock ubus server is shared and stateful, the device
  already matched, the plan was empty, and Apply returned at its early guard.
  When a test depends on the subject actually running, assert that it ran.
- **Review what a fix IMPLIES, not only whether it is correct.** §5at's worst
  finding was caused by §5as. `Retain` and `Blind` deliberately broke an
  invariant that `ReplaceOwned` had stated in plain English one package away,
  and the consequence was un-adopt silently losing the ability to remove our own
  config. After changing an invariant, grep for who relied on it — the fix and
  the reliance are rarely in the same file.
- **Do not let a repair depend on behaviour nobody measured.** Detecting the
  malformed list was worth nothing if the write that fixes it needs `uci.set` to
  convert an option into a list, which this repository has never tested. Deleting
  the option first costs one staged call and removes the assumption. Where an
  unverified assumption fails silently, engineer around it rather than betting on
  it.
- **Mutation testing needs a COMMITTED baseline.** `git checkout <file>` restores
  the last commit, not the state before the mutation — so undoing a mutation
  while the fix is still uncommitted reverts the fix too, and every subsequent
  mutation "fails" against code that never had the fix in it. That produces a
  clean-looking kill sheet that proves nothing. Commit the fix first, or restore
  from a file copy. Found in §5as, three mutations into a run that looked fine.
- **Follow a three-state value all the way to its LAST consumer.** `capability`
  is meticulous about Denied vs Absent and carries the distinction perfectly
  into `render` — which then let `Prune` read "no sections" as "the operator
  removed them" and delete every interface on the device. The producer being
  careful is not the property that matters; the property that matters is that
  nobody downstream re-collapses it. **Deletion is where the collapse costs
  most**, because it converts a missing answer into a destroyed fact.
- **A normalising transform that SHORTENS a name can only merge things.** A
  uniqueness constraint upstream guarantees nothing once a renderer truncates
  what it guaranteed. `safe()` capped names at 11 characters to prevent two
  zones colliding and thereby collided every pair of networks sharing a prefix.
  Ask which namespace each limit actually belongs to — fw4's zone names are
  capped; UCI section names are not — and never apply one namespace's limit to
  another's identifiers.
- **When a warning tells the operator what to do, check that doing it works.**
  `hardware-unidentified` advised "apply a WLAN and re-probe" while the apply was
  the very thing deleting the WLAN. A mitigation string is a claim about
  behaviour and ages exactly like code, with nothing compiling it.

## 7. Practical notes

- The module requires **Go 1.25** because `modernc.org/sqlite` does and pins the
  patched **Go 1.26.6** toolchain. The container builder uses the same patch
  release; `govulncheck` was clean under it on 2026-08-18.
- `CGO_ENABLED=0` cross-compiles cleanly for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` —
  verified, and the reason decision D3 chose that driver.
- **The device credential is not recorded in this repo, and must not be.** This
  repo is public, and a password committed to it stays in the history after any
  later edit. One was committed here and is now dead — rotated 2026-08-15 — but
  it cost an hour first, in the way stale secrets always do: it was *recorded*,
  so it was *trusted*, so a login failure looked like a broken device rather
  than a wrong password.

  It is rotated by every adoption, which is what makes drift the normal case
  rather than the exception.

  **To find out whether the one you have is right**, ask the device rather than
  a document:

  ```bash
  curl -s http://192.0.2.1/ubus -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"call",
    "params":["00000000000000000000000000000000","session","login",
    {"username":"oonfeewrt","password":"THE-ONE-YOU-HAVE"}]}'
  ```

  A `ubus_rpc_session` in the reply means yes; `"result":[6]` means no.

  **To settle it definitively** — whether the password is wrong or something
  else is — compare against the stored hash, which SSH can read and ubus
  deliberately cannot:

  ```bash
  ssh root@192.0.2.1 "uci get rpcd.oonfeewrt.password"
  openssl passwd -6 -salt "<the salt between the 2nd and 3rd \$>" "THE-ONE-YOU-HAVE"
  ```

  Equal means the password is fine and the problem is elsewhere; unequal means
  it was rotated. That check turned an hour of guessing into one command.

  **To set a known one** (no re-adoption, does not touch the ACL file):

  ```bash
  ssh root@192.0.2.1 "uci set rpcd.oonfeewrt.password='$(openssl passwd -6 'NEW')' \
    && uci commit rpcd"
  ```

  rpcd re-reads the login config at session-creation time, so no restart is
  needed — and restarting it would destroy every live session.

  If the login section is gone entirely, re-adopt: that rewrites both
  `/usr/share/rpcd/acl.d/oonfeewrt.json` and the `rpcd` login, and
  `TestIntegrationAdoptARealDevice` prints the credential it creates.
- Running the daemon from a checkout:

  ```bash
  go run ./cmd/oonfeewrtd -data-dir "$PWD/.run" -listen 127.0.0.1:8080
  ```

  It prompts for an operator passphrase on a terminal (twice on first run,
  because a typo there is a keyring nobody can open), or reads one from a mode
  0600 file given by `-passphrase-file` / `OONFEE_PASSPHRASE_FILE`. It refuses a
  passphrase in `OONFEE_PASSPHRASE` — env is readable from `/proc`, inherited by
  children, and printed by `docker inspect`. The data directory is created 0700
  and holds `keyring.json` plus `oonfeewrt.db`. They are one cryptographic
  restore pair: first-run keyring creation is atomic/no-clobber, a non-empty
  database with no keyring is refused, and schema 14 rejects a mismatched pair
  before WAL, migration, or other mutation.

- Building and running the whole thing:

  ```bash
  npm --prefix ui install && npm --prefix ui run build && ./tools/budget_check.sh
  ```

  Then `go run ./cmd/oonfeewrtd -data-dir "$PWD/.run" -listen 127.0.0.1:8080`
  and open <http://127.0.0.1:8080>. The Go binary embeds `ui/dist`; building
  without it still works and serves an explanation instead of a blank page.
  `npm --prefix ui run dev` proxies /api to a daemon on :8080 for UI work.

- Adoption now works from the UI (the `＋` rail icon) or
  `POST /api/v1/devices/adopt`. It needs the device's admin credential once, for
  SSH — see §4. Re-adopting rotates the controller login and narrows it to
  production scope, which breaks the applyengine hardware tests: they write to a
  scratch config in the ACL's separate `oonfeewrt-probe` group, which adoption
  deliberately does not grant. Re-enable them with:

  ```bash
  ssh root@192.0.2.1 "uci add_list rpcd.oonfeewrt.read=oonfeewrt-probe; uci add_list rpcd.oonfeewrt.write=oonfeewrt-probe; uci commit rpcd"
  ```

- The older path, if you need it: seeding a device by hand means sealing its
  credential with `Keeper.SealCredential(mac, user, pass)` and writing a
  `store.Device` with `AdoptedAt` set. `internal/daemon/integration_test.go`
  does exactly that and is the shortest working example.

- **Both devices are adopted into `.run/`**, with their credential ciphertexts
  in `.run/oonfeewrt.db` under the random data key wrapped by
  `.run/keyring.json`. Adoption never returns the generated password. Losing
  either the passphrase or matching keyring means restoring the pair or
  re-adopting; a passphrase alone cannot recreate the random data key.

  The two-AP neighbour test is also the setup helper. It re-adopts what it can,
  reuses and re-probes what is already adopted, and reuses the site model rather
  than recreating it, so it is safe to run repeatedly:

  ```bash
  OONFEE_NEIGHBOURS=1 OONFEE_SEED_DIR="$PWD/.run" OONFEE_SEED_PASSFILE=/path/pass \
    OONFEE_AP1=192.0.2.1 OONFEE_AP2=192.0.2.2 \
    OONFEE_ADMIN_USER=root OONFEE_ADMIN_PASS= \
    OONFEE_WLAN_SSID=example-managed-wlan OONFEE_WLAN_KEY=... \
    go test -tags=integration ./internal/daemon/ -run TestIntegrationNeighbours -v
  ```

  Re-adopting narrows the login to production scope, so §7's `add_list` grant
  command has to be re-run afterwards for the applyengine hardware tests.

- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md` §14 and §15 are the authoritative record of measured
  behaviour. When code and docs disagree, the measurement wins — and if neither
  matches the device, re-measure before changing either.
