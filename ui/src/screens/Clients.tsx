 * The Client Devices grid.
 *
 * The honest part of this screen is the columns that may be empty. Association,
 * access point and signal come from hostapd on every baseline poll; TX retries
 * alone require the focused iwinfo tier. A row no managed AP reports stays
 * unknown rather than being called wired or given a made-up zero.
 *
 * Fetches its own page, like the log. It used to be handed the whole inventory
 * and filter it here, which is correct only while one response holds the whole
 * table: past that, filtering the fetched window selects from the newest N
 * clients overall rather than the newest N matching, and the rail counts the
 * page instead of the table.
