mock_ubus.py — a faithful-enough ubus-over-HTTP simulator of a WRT3200ACM.

This is the contract fixture for oonfeeWRT development: probe.py, the Go ubus
client, and the apply-engine integration tests all run against it, so product
code can be built and CI'd with zero hardware.

    python3 mock_ubus.py [--port 8088]
    # login password: "good"

What it models faithfully (because the design depends on it):

  * UCI staged-vs-committed semantics. `uci.set/add/delete` STAGE a delta.
    `uci.commit` applies one config's delta. `uci.apply {rollback:true}`
    commits ALL staged deltas, snapshots the pre-apply committed state, and
    arms a rollback timer; `uci.confirm` cancels it; timer expiry RESTORES the
    snapshot. Committing manually before apply therefore disarms rollback —
    exactly like real rpcd, and exactly the bug class the probe exists to catch.
  * JSON-RPC batching (array bodies).
  * WRT3200ACM identity: mvebu/cortexa9, 512 MB RAM, DSA switch, dual radios.
  * Per-session state, as measured on hardware: each login gets its own token,
    staged UCI deltas are scoped to it, and `uci.confirm` is refused to any
    session other than the one that applied — without cancelling the timer.
    After a rollback the applying session still reads the value it failed to
    set, while a fresh session reads the reverted one.
  * mwlwifi's real survey quirks: `iwinfo.survey` works, but reports `noise`
    unsigned and leaves rx_time/tx_time uninitialised, so airtime is
    computable and interference is not.

What it does not model: timing realism, hostapd events, or multiple devices
(run several instances on different ports for a fleet). Wireless apply updates
its per-section runtime inventory immediately; product code still polls it.
