# Capabilities and limits

This is the user-facing capability boundary for **oonfeeWRT v0.1.1**. It is
intentionally narrower than the long-term roadmap.

## How to read status

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Shipped** | Present in v0.1.1 source, UI/API, and automated tests |
| **Hardware-verified** | Exercised on the published physical-router validation setup |
| **Capability-dependent** | Shipped, but visibility or operation depends on the router, driver, package set, and measured source |
| **Source-tested only** | Automated contracts exist, but the published hardware run did not execute the disruptive or optional operation |
| **Unverified** | Intended/shipped path lacks the stated physical topology or hardware proof |
| **Unavailable** | Not provided by v0.1.1 or deliberately outside the project boundary |

An unavailable measurement is not a zero. The UI distinguishes unknown,
unsupported, stale, partial, and observed-empty evidence.

## Deployment and controller

| Capability | v0.1.1 status | Important boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Standalone Linux/macOS controller | **Shipped** | amd64 and arm64 release archives |
| Linux container/Compose deployment | **Shipped** | amd64/arm64, non-root scratch image, read-only root filesystem in supplied Compose setup |
| Embedded web UI | **Shipped** | One process; no separate web server |
| Local SQLite storage | **Shipped** | WAL mode; database and keyring must be backed up together |
| Light and dark controller themes | **Shipped** | UI-side switch; v0.1.1 defaults to dark and does not persist the choice across reloads |
| Native controller TLS | **Unavailable** | Use a trusted reverse proxy or trusted isolated management LAN |
| Cloud account or relay | **Unavailable** | Self-hosted only |
| Multi-site/NAT traversal | **Unavailable by design** | Use an existing routed management network or VPN |
| Controller running on a router | **Unsupported** | Not built, packaged, tested, or budgeted for OpenWrt-hosted operation |

## Discovery, inspection, and adoption

| Capability | v0.1.1 status | Important boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Add router by management address | **Shipped, hardware-verified** | Works without layer-2 discovery |
| On-demand discovery | **Shipped** | ARP/mDNS coverage depends on host/container networking |
| Read-only pre-adoption inspection | **Shipped, hardware-verified** | Authenticates to the router but creates no router/controller inventory state |
| Explicit Gateway/AP/Switch function selection | **Shipped, hardware-verified** | A device may have multiple functions; function choice controls rendered intent |
| Scoped controller login and ACL | **Shipped, hardware-verified** | Separate default-off consent; one login and one ACL file, no package/executable |
| Capability probe and re-probe | **Shipped, hardware-verified** | Stores measured support/gaps; firmware changes do not have to leave stale capability truth forever |
| SSH-free steady-state management | **Shipped** | Polling and Apply use ubus; SSH remains bounded bootstrap/cleanup/optional-capability transport |
| Automatic package install during adoption | **Unavailable by design** | Optional capabilities use separate plan/consent |

## Fleet visibility and telemetry

| Capability | v0.1.1 status | Important boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Device inventory, health, model, firmware, uptime | **Shipped, hardware-verified** | Freshness and source gaps remain visible |
| Interface throughput and durable metric history | **Shipped, hardware-verified** | Five-minute rollups for 14 days; hourly for 396 days |
| Management-overhead readout | **Shipped, hardware-verified** | Reports poll interval, request rate/bytes, failures, installed-capability packages, and only measured attributable CPU estimates |
| Per-device poll interval override | **Shipped** | UI offers 60 seconds to 15 minutes. `0` clears the override, and values below the controller default do not increase the effective poll rate |
| OpenWrt log ingestion | **Shipped, hardware-verified** | Once per minute, bounded retention and explicit continuity gaps |
| Live UI updates | **Shipped** | Bounded WebSocket `device.stats`; durable history remains SQLite-backed |
| Application/DPI identification and flow history | **Unavailable** | No controller-authored router agent; DPI is outside the constrained-device budget |

## Dashboard and WAN evidence

| Capability | v0.1.1 status | Important boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Fleet status and warning/error summary | **Shipped** | Partial data is disclosed rather than flattened |
| WAN reachability charts/table | **Shipped, hardware-verified** | Gateway sends three ICMP probes to fixed `1.1.1.1` at most once per minute; this is not full ISP uptime, HTTP, or DNS validation |
| WAN/interface throughput | **Shipped** | Source and missing-sample provenance are shown |
| Controller-host speed test | **Shipped** | Cloudflare endpoint, about 15 MiB, one active job, 30-second hard bound, three terminal results retained |
| Gateway-run speed test | **Unavailable in v0.1.1** | Would need a separately approved router capability |
| Loaded latency and loaded jitter | **Unavailable** | The controller-host method reports idle latency/jitter only |

## Topology

| Capability | v0.1.1 status | Important boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Internet → gateway → infrastructure → client graph | **Shipped, hardware-verified** | Inferred from route, FDB/neighbor, association, and optional LLDP evidence |
| Current measured/inferred source labels | **Shipped** | Ambiguous links stay ambiguous; expired evidence can leave an online device unplaced |
| Topology history | **Shipped** | Closed intervals retained for 31 days |
| Baseline topology without extra package | **Shipped** | BusyBox FDB sources may lack VLAN identity |
| LLDP adjacency enrichment | **Shipped optional workflow, hardware-verified** | Exact official-feed package/config/service plan, separate consent, durable rollback ledger |
| Continuous physical truth without LLDP | **Unavailable** | Dynamic FDB evidence can age out |

## Clients and observability

| Capability | v0.1.1 status | Important boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Client inventory, address/name/vendor hints, association and connection source | **Shipped, hardware-verified** | Depends on host hints, DHCP/neighbor and wireless sources available on each router |
| Current wireless signal/rates/retries | **Capability-dependent, hardware-verified** | Driver/hostapd source gaps are disclosed |
| Client observability timeline | **Shipped, hardware-verified** | Joins bounded exact events, topology intervals, AP/radio/path evidence, and rollups at one cursor |
| Wi-Fi experience score | **Shipped, capability-dependent** | Requires RSSI, retry delta, and TX-failure delta in one sample; missing inputs do not get reweighted |
| Private-MAC indication | **Shipped** | Warning from the locally administered MAC bit, not identity proof |
| Durable per-client application usage | **Unavailable** | Requires optional accounting/DPI not shipped as a v0.1.1 controller capability |

## Radios and RF

| Capability | v0.1.1 status | Important boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Radio inventory, band, channel, width, power, client count | **Shipped, hardware-verified** | Stable radio identity is separated from driver naming |
| Channel-plan view | **Shipped, hardware-verified** | Shows In use, Enabled, Restricted, or Unknown from actual frequency evidence |
| Channel utilization | **Shipped, hardware-verified** | Derived from deltas of driver `busy_time`/`active_time`, never absolute counters |
| Noise/SNR | **Capability-dependent** | Hidden/unavailable when driver evidence is unstable or incorrectly encoded |
| Interference and airtime split | **Capability-dependent** | Requires trustworthy RX/TX airtime; unavailable on the verified mwlwifi reference |
| Manual RF scan | **Shipped, hardware-verified** | Explicit disruption acknowledgement, 45-second timeout, 4,096 BSS-row bound, newest terminal result retained; one C6 5 GHz validation scan found 14 BSS entries and suggested channel 44 |
| Suggested channels | **Shipped, capability-dependent** | Requires scan no older than 24 hours, fresh radio state, and recent channel plan |
| Continuous spectrum-analyzer waterfall | **Unavailable** | Requires radio/silicon capabilities not exposed as portable OpenWrt evidence |

## Site configuration

| Capability | v0.1.1 status | Important boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Site-wide WLANs and AP groups | **Shipped, hardware-verified** | Deterministic fan-out to selected APs; write-only secrets remain redacted after save |
| 2.4/5/6 GHz and WPA2/WPA3/OWE/open WLAN fields | **Shipped, capability-dependent** | Includes PMF and 802.11r/k/v fields; hardware defects and missing support can block or warn |
| Networks, VLANs, addressing, and DHCP intent | **Shipped** | Rendered only to devices with the required Gateway/Switch function and capabilities |
| Firewall zones and directed forwarding | **Shipped** | Controller-owned firewall4 sections only |
| IPv4 policy records, static routes, and port forwards | **Shipped** | Preview/gates remain authoritative; application-based matching is unavailable without DPI |
| Client block and fixed-IPv4 desired policy | **Shipped** | Per-client rate limiting, QoS/SQM, and application/DPI policy backends are unavailable in v0.1.1 |
| Per-device overrides | **Shipped** | Limited to WLAN publication, hidden beacon, isolation, and client limit; SSID/key/security/PMF/roaming settings cannot diverge per AP |
| Preview and multi-device Apply | **Shipped, hardware-verified** | Full-fleet preflight, OpenWrt rollback timer, runtime verification, durable receipts |
| Automatic silent reconciliation of every desired edit | **Unavailable by design** | Saving does not Apply; operator review remains required |

## Roaming, mesh, and uplink

The site model and controller include 802.11k neighbour distribution, WLAN
roaming fields, mesh/backhaul records, uplinks, and health surfaces. The
published two-router evidence verifies WLAN fan-out and client reassociation
between the reference APs. Controller-managed 802.11k neighbour distribution is
built and source-tested, not physically proven by that record. The roam also
does not prove that 802.11r Fast Transition was used.

The following release boundaries remain:

- three-or-more-AP fan-out is **unverified**;
- real mesh backhaul is **unverified**;
- wireless uplink is **unverified**; and
- the controller does not claim to replace hardware/driver-specific steering
  behavior with its own router agent.

## Accounts, backup, and diagnostics

| Capability | v0.1.1 status | Important boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Owner, Administrator, Operator, Read-only roles | **Shipped** | Server-enforced; see [Permissions](../concepts/permissions.md) |
| Session inventory/revocation and password step-up | **Shipped** | Sessions are in memory and end on restart |
| Redacted diagnostics ZIP | **Shipped** | Stored evidence only; no router calls; Administrator+ |
| Encrypted `.oowrtbak` export | **Shipped** | Separate unrecoverable export passphrase; Owner + recent reauth |
| Staged restore preview | **Shipped** | Disposable validation/migration before replacement |
| Confirmed restore with safety artifact and write suppression | **Shipped** | No automatic router Apply; all sessions revoked |

## Published hardware evidence

The stable-release documentation carries physical evidence for Linksys WRT3200ACM and
TP-Link Archer C6 v2 on OpenWrt 25.12.5. The Archer C6 v2 passed the 60-minute
class-C polling/resource budget: 209 poll batches, no failures, and no observed
overlay write. That fresh-start evidence was produced through the pre-stable/RC
workflow and underlies the stable release; v0.1.1 did not rerun the entire
hardware procedure, and its router-operation code was unchanged.

That evidence is deliberately specific. It does not prove all ath79, mwlwifi,
MT7621, Filogic, DSA, swconfig, mesh, or multi-AP combinations. Review the
[fresh-start validation record](../FRESH-START-VALIDATION.md) for exact evidence
and accepted gaps.

The WRT3200ACM evidence also records a severe board/driver boundary: its Marvell
88W8964/mwlwifi setup can wedge under WPA3/SAE or PMF until a physical cold power
cycle. The safely demonstrated configuration was WPA2-only, PMF disabled, FT
disabled, and 802.11k/v enabled after cold boot. Do not generalize a WLAN option
being present in the model into proof that this router can run it safely.

The current controller serves REST/WebSocket routes under `/api/v1`, but v0.1.1
does not publish a stable third-party API compatibility guarantee. Treat that
surface as the controller/UI contract unless a future release documents one.
