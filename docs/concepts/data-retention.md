# Data and retention

oonfeeWRT v0.1.3 keeps configuration, evidence, and audit history locally. It
does not require a cloud account or external database.

## Storage locations

The data directory is selected by `-data-dir` or `OONFEE_DATA_DIR`. It must be
an absolute path; the container default is `/data`.

Important contents include:

| Path | Contents | Persistence |
|---|---|---|
| `oonfeewrt.db` | SQLite database: accounts, site intent, device inventory, sealed credential records, rollups, events, audit history, operations | Persistent |
| `keyring.json` | Wrapped random data key used to seal credentials | Persistent and inseparable from the database |
| `diagnostics/` | Temporary generated diagnostics ZIPs | Terminal artifact expires after 15 minutes |
| `backups/` | Temporary portable export jobs and downloads | Terminal artifact expires after 15 minutes |
| `restores/` | Uploaded backup and disposable preview state | Expires after 30 minutes |
| `.oonfeewrt-recovery/` | Encrypted pre-restore safety artifacts and restore recovery records | Persistent, bounded after restore acknowledgement |
| controller log files | Bounded structured controller logs used by diagnostics | Persistent within the controller's log policy; not included in `.oowrtbak` |

All controller data is sensitive. Keep the data directory private and do not
serve it as static content.

## Compatibility reports are not retained

The v0.1.2+ compatibility report is returned only as an optional field of a
successful read-only Inspect response. It is not written to SQLite, a job
directory, diagnostics, or portable backup. Clicking **Export sanitized
compatibility report** serializes that already-sanitized object in the browser;
there is no second router call, controller-side file, or upload.

Once downloaded, `oonfeewrt-compatibility-report.json` is outside oonfeeWRT's
retention and deletion controls. Protect or delete it using the workstation's
normal file policy. It intentionally excludes timestamps, live telemetry,
network configuration, deployment identity, addresses, clients, credentials,
and secrets, but it still describes the router model, firmware, radios, ports,
and capability states. Do not substitute the full Inspect response when a
report is unavailable: that response is not the share-safe format.

## Metric retention

Raw samples are not inserted into SQLite one at a time. They stay in an
in-memory ring until a complete five-minute window is ready, then the completed
rollups are written in one transaction. A shutdown flushes complete buckets and
discards an incomplete bucket rather than presenting partial data as canonical.

The shipped policy is:

| Data | Retention | Detail |
|---|---:|---|
| Raw telemetry samples | Memory only | Lost on restart before the current window completes |
| Five-minute rollups | 14 days | High-resolution recent metrics |
| Hourly rollups | 396 days | The code's 13-month retention value |

Series queries choose resolution from the requested range. Requests beginning
more than 14 days ago, or spanning more than seven days, use hourly data. This
keeps responses bounded and avoids implying that old five-minute points still
exist.

## Event and topology retention

| Data | Shipped bound |
|---|---:|
| OpenWrt `logd` events | 24 hours |
| OpenWrt events per device | Newest 50,000 |
| OpenWrt events across the controller | Newest 100,000 |
| Controller and audit events | Newest 100,000, independent of router-log caps |
| Encoded event text/detail | 64 KiB per row |
| Closed topology intervals | 31 days |
| Current topology intervals | Kept while active; they have no expiry timestamp |

When per-device or global row-count caps truncate router-log evidence, the
controller records a continuity gap rather than making the remaining history
look complete. The ordinary 24-hour age prune does not add that marker.
Repeated exact OpenWrt IPv6 router-advertisement/no-default-route warnings may
be condensed per producer epoch while retaining counts and source boundaries.

### What v0.1.3 retains about the effective WAN

The collector does not store the raw `ip` route-table output or raw netifd dump
as WAN history. A successful composite observation produces the scoped logical
network state plus a measured Internet topology edge whose port is the kernel
route interface. Current Dashboard and Device Detail use that edge only while
the device is online and both its route source and edge are at most 31 minutes
old.

If either half of the composite read fails, the collector records a source gap
and preserves the last proved network scope instead of replacing it with a
partial guess. Preserved is not the same as current: stale proof does not power
the current WAN selection. Closed route-derived topology intervals follow the
31-day topology policy above. Interface throughput still follows the ordinary
five-minute/hourly metric retention; no distinct per-uplink or failover history
is created.

## Bounded operational history

| Surface | Retention |
|---|---|
| RF scans | Newest terminal result for each stable device/radio identity; pending/running work is preserved |
| Controller-host speed tests | Newest three completed or failed attempts; an active attempt is separate |
| Diagnostics jobs | Up to 20 job records; completed ZIP available for 15 minutes |
| Portable backup exports | Up to five job records; completed download available for 15 minutes |
| Restore uploads/previews | Up to five uploads and five previews; 30-minute working retention |

On the first v0.1.1 start, older completed/failed speed-test rows beyond the
newest three are permanently pruned. Back up v0.1.0 data before upgrading if
that history matters.

v0.1.2 and v0.1.3 both use schema 19. The v0.1.2 → v0.1.3 upgrade adds no
migration and no startup deletion; its WAN behavior changes how new read-only
observations are interpreted.

## Diagnostics content and limits

Diagnostics are generated from stored controller evidence only. Generation
makes no router management call and changes no router.

The bundle can contain controller version/schema/health, stored device
model/firmware/capability facts, coverage state, bounded events, and a redacted
controller-log tail. It excludes controller passphrases, password hashes,
session/CSRF tokens, router credentials, Wi-Fi keys, private keys/certificates,
the raw database/keyring, client notes, and fixed-address assignments.

The generator caps input and output, including 256 devices, 1,024 source rows,
1,000 event rows, a 2 MiB output log tail, 4 MiB per archive member, and 16 MiB
total uncompressed member data. These are safety ceilings, not promised bundle
sizes.

## Portable backups and safety artifacts

An owner can export an encrypted `.oowrtbak` containing a transactionally
consistent database snapshot and portable wrapped key material. It includes
controller accounts/password hashes, settings, desired state, inventory,
telemetry/events, and saved credentials in encrypted form. It excludes active
sessions, the runtime passphrase, router firmware/files, controller logs, and
other backup/diagnostic artifacts.

The export passphrase is separate from the runtime passphrase, is never stored
by the controller, and cannot be recovered. Keep the artifact and its
passphrase in separate protected locations.

Before a confirmed restore replaces live state, the controller writes an
encrypted safety artifact at:

```text
<data-dir>/.oonfeewrt-recovery/safety-<restore-id>.oowrtbak
```

After the applied-restore audit receipt is cleared, retention targets the three
newest recognized safety artifacts. Files referenced by an active restore
marker, receipt, or suppression record are preserved even if that temporarily
exceeds three. Copy any safety artifact needed for long-term retention before
it becomes eligible for pruning.

## What a valid filesystem backup contains

`oonfeewrt.db` and its matching `keyring.json` are one recovery pair. The
passphrase is required to open the keyring but cannot reconstruct a lost
keyring. A keyring from another controller cannot open the sealed credential
records in the database.

Because SQLite uses WAL mode, copying only a live `oonfeewrt.db` can omit
committed data. Use one of these methods:

- SQLite's online `.backup`, followed by a copy of the matching keyring; or
- a clean controller shutdown, then copy the database and keyring together.

For the container, stop it cleanly before copying the persistent volume. Keep
the passphrase file separately.

Verify an isolated pair with the release helper:

```sh
OONFEE_PASSPHRASE_FILE=/absolute/path/to/mode-600-passphrase \
  oonfeewrt-recoverycheck /absolute/path/to/backup/oonfeewrt.db
```

The sibling `keyring.json` must be beside the database. The helper is read-only,
makes no network call, requires current schema, rejects symlinks, and rejects a
non-empty `-wal` or `-journal` sidecar. See [CLI reference](../reference/cli.md).

## Deletion and un-adoption

Removing a device deletes its controller inventory and eventually sweeps metric
series that no longer have a device. Un-adoption is not merely database
deletion: it first attempts the reviewed router cleanup, and optional-capability
rollback can block it. Export diagnostics or evidence before removal if the
history is needed.

The controller does not claim that every deletion is recoverable. Treat
account deletion, device removal, retention pruning, and restore replacement as
material operations and preserve a verified backup first.
