# Wi-Fi, roaming, and overrides

oonfeeWRT models a WLAN once and fans it out to the selected APs. AP groups and
bounded per-device overrides let a mixed fleet share intent without pretending
every radio and driver behaves identically.

<div class="write-impact warning"><strong>Router write impact</strong><span>Editing and saving WLAN intent is controller-only. Apply can create or update controller-owned `wireless` sections and related network/firewall state. RF scans are a separate disruptive action.</span></div>

## Before you change Wi-Fi

- Back up the controller and the OpenWrt configuration on a test AP.
- Confirm each target has the **AP** function and fresh radio capability data.
- Record the existing SSID, security mode, passphrase, bands, channels, and
  management path.
- Use a wired management path for the first change when possible.
- Check whether the AP is using a wireless uplink; changing its serving radio
  can disconnect both clients and controller management.
- Decide which radios/APs belong together before creating groups.

## Build the site structure

### AP groups

An AP group selects where a WLAN is eligible to broadcast. Use groups for real
placement or policy boundaries, such as `All APs`, `Downstairs`, or `Guest
areas`. Avoid one group per device unless the intent is genuinely unique.

The effective target is the intersection of:

- devices with the AP function;
- group membership;
- detected radio/band capabilities;
- WLAN settings and any bounded override;
- safety/capability gates in the preview.

### WLANs

A WLAN describes the shared intent:

- SSID and enabled state;
- security mode and passphrase when required;
- target AP group;
- network attachment;
- band/radio eligibility;
- protected management frames (PMF);
- 802.11r fast transition;
- 802.11k neighbour reports and 802.11v steering-related options exposed by
  the current UI.

The API and preview do not reveal stored WLAN or mesh keys, including legacy
reveal query patterns. Replace a forgotten passphrase; do not expect the
controller to display it.

## Create or update a WLAN

1. Open **Settings → Network** and find the Wi-Fi/WLAN section.
2. Choose **Add WLAN**, or open the WLAN you intend to change.
3. Enter the SSID exactly as clients should see it.
4. Select a security mode supported by every target AP/client combination.
5. Enter a passphrase when the mode requires one.
6. Choose the client network and AP group.
7. Set band and roaming options conservatively for a mixed fleet.
8. Save desired state.
9. Generate a fresh Preview and expand every target device.

Check that the preview fans out to the intended APs and does not silently omit
a radio. An omission should include a reason, such as missing capability,
incompatible band, device function, or unreadable source.

## Security modes and PMF

Use a mode supported by the oldest required client and the target OpenWrt
driver. PMF requirements must agree with the selected security mode; the UI
clamps combinations that cannot be valid, but capability evidence still
matters at Apply time.

Roll out stricter security in stages:

1. create a test WLAN or target one AP;
2. verify representative clients can associate and obtain DHCP;
3. verify DNS, Internet, and required local services;
4. expand to the remaining group;
5. retire the older WLAN only after observing the migration.

## 802.11k, 802.11v, and 802.11r

These features help clients make roaming decisions; they do not force a client
to roam well.

- **802.11k** provides neighbour information. oonfeeWRT can maintain managed
  neighbour state when capabilities and complete observations support it.
- **802.11v** can provide transition guidance where the driver and client
  support it.
- **802.11r** reduces authentication handoff cost but requires compatible
  security and consistent configuration across participating APs.

Keep SSID, security, passphrase, and roaming identifiers consistent across the
roaming domain. Start with two APs and a known client. Observe actual
association changes in Clients/Topology rather than assuming an enabled toggle
proves roaming.

The automatic 802.11k neighbour reconciler is a router-write path. It runs only
when router writes are not globally suppressed, and uses the managed evidence
and ownership rules. After a controller restore, review neighbour intent before
entering `RESUME ROUTER WRITES`.

## Mesh backhauls

Mesh settings describe a shared backhaul and SAE key across participating
devices. An empty key creates an open mesh, which permits any compatible nearby
node to join and reach the network behind it.

::: danger Secure mesh backhauls
Use a strong mesh passphrase unless the deployment is an isolated lab. Treat a
mesh key change as a management-path change when APs rely on that backhaul.
:::

Mesh support is capability-gated. Real mesh-backhaul behavior remains outside
the published live-hardware evidence for v0.1.1, so validate on non-critical
devices and keep a wired recovery path.

## Wireless uplinks

A wireless uplink makes an infrastructure device a client of another WLAN.
Changing its band, SSID, key, or upstream AP can sever controller reachability.
The UI exposes both the network intent and traversal hazards; read each preview
acknowledgement.

Wireless-uplink scenarios are implemented but not part of the published live
hardware validation set. Do not roll them across a remote fleet without local
recovery.

## Per-device overrides

Overrides are for bounded hardware differences. They must not fork the WLAN's
identity or security contract across APs. The v0.1.1 UI permits per-device
publication, hidden-SSID, and client-isolation overrides. It does not permit
SSID, passphrase, security-mode, roaming, band, or radio-channel overrides.

If many devices need the same override, change the group or shared WLAN intent
instead. Repeated one-off overrides make preview review and future hardware
replacement harder.

## Existing broadcasts and takeover

Pre-adoption inspection may find human-managed wireless sections. oonfeeWRT
does not silently claim them. The device detail can present a takeover brief
that identifies the broadcast and the consequences of leaving it unmanaged or
disabling it.

Review provenance by section, not only by SSID: two sections can broadcast the
same SSID while having different owners or purposes. A takeover brief never
includes the passphrase.

## Apply and test

1. Apply to one test AP or the smallest practical group.
2. Keep the device powered while the OpenWrt rollback window is active.
3. Confirm the durable receipt reports success and expected state.
4. From a test client, forget stale credentials if appropriate and associate.
5. Verify DHCP, DNS, Internet, and intended local-zone access.
6. Check the Clients page for AP/radio attribution and source freshness.
7. Walk between two APs and correlate association history before declaring
   roaming successful.
8. Expand the group only after the result is repeatable.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| WLAN omitted from one AP | Band/radio capability, AP function, group membership, or unreadable source | Expand that device's preview and capability report; do not force the section manually |
| Client sees SSID but cannot join | Security/PMF/client incompatibility or wrong key | Test a known client, verify mode, replace rather than reveal the passphrase, and review OpenWrt logs |
| Client joins but gets no address | Network attachment, VLAN path, DHCP, or firewall input | Follow [Networks, VLANs, and DHCP](./networks.md) from AP through Gateway |
| Roaming does not occur | Client decision, inconsistent domain settings, missing 802.11k/v/r support, or RF design | Verify configuration consistency, capability evidence, signal/channel design, and actual association history |
| AP becomes unreachable after Apply | Wireless management/uplink path changed | Wait for rollback; use wired/local recovery if it cannot reconnect; inspect the durable Apply outcome before retrying |
| Preview reports foreign wireless conflict | Existing human-owned section overlaps the requested intent | Choose explicit manual ownership or a distinct WLAN; do not delete the foreign section blindly |
