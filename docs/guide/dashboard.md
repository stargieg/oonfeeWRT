# Dashboard and Internet health

The Dashboard answers three questions quickly: **is the controller receiving
fresh evidence, can the managed Gateway reach the Internet, and where should I
investigate next?** It combines fleet counts, WAN observations, topology,
speed-test history, and recent warnings without hiding missing sources.

## Before you begin

- Sign in with any controller role, including **Read only**.
- Adopt at least one device to populate fleet health.
- Assign the **Gateway** function to the device that carries the default route
  if you want Internet health. oonfeeWRT supports one managed Gateway.
- Allow time for the first collection cycle. An empty value before collection
  is different from an observed zero.

## Read the fleet overview

The overview cards summarize the whole current fleet:

| Card | Meaning | Investigate when |
|---|---|---|
| Devices online | Devices with sufficiently recent successful management evidence | The online count falls or a device alternates between states |
| Wireless clients | Fresh stations attributed to devices with the AP function | The value is marked incomplete or differs from an AP's local view |
| Devices on the LAN | Client inventory scoped to managed LANs | Infrastructure appears as a client or a neighbour is incorrectly scoped |
| Devices in focus | Devices temporarily using the fast collection tier because a live detail view is open | The count stays high after viewers leave detail screens |
| Series collected | Durable metric series currently known to the controller | Charts remain empty after several collection intervals |

Counts carry source-coverage information. A partial wireless-client count is
not silently presented as a complete fleet total. Follow the adjacent source
message before treating a number as authoritative.

## Understand Internet health

Internet health is derived from the managed Gateway, not from the browser and
not from a cloud service.

### Observed Gateway path

v0.1.3 identifies one effective IPv4 uplink from the installed kernel routing
table. It selects the unique usable, lowest-metric default in the main table,
then maps that kernel device to exactly one active OpenWrt logical interface
that also reports a default-route candidate. This prevents a modem-management
interface from winning merely because netifd listed it first and maps logical
`wan` to the runtime `pppoe-wan` device when appropriate.

The route table and `network.interface` dump form one observation. If either
read fails, the route is malformed, equal lowest metrics point to different
devices, a multipath route is present, or the kernel device cannot be mapped
uniquely, the current path is unavailable. The controller preserves its last
proved network cache but does not turn that cache into a new route claim or
guess a counter series.

This scope is deliberately narrow: custom policy routing, `mwan3`, per-uplink
health, manual WAN selection, and bond-member monitoring are not modeled. A
policy-selected path can differ from the observed main-table route. Route
evidence runs on the approximately 15-minute network/topology cycle, so use a
dedicated failover monitor when sub-minute detection matters.

### ICMP reachability

The Gateway sends exactly three ICMP probes to `1.1.1.1`, no more than once per
minute. The displayed latency and loss establish only that this target was
reachable over ICMP at that time.

They do **not** prove:

- DNS works;
- HTTP or HTTPS works;
- every Internet destination is reachable;
- the ISP has met an uptime target;
- the router itself has available bandwidth.

ICMP may also be deprioritized by a network. Correlate loss with traffic,
events, device state, and an independent application test.

### Six-hour trends

The chart and accessible table show five-minute rollups for:

- download traffic;
- upload traffic;
- ICMP latency;
- ICMP loss.

Coverage markers distinguish observed buckets from unavailable ones. A gap is
not a zero. Use the table when you need exact timestamps and values; use the
chart to correlate simultaneous changes.

## Run a controller speed test

The speed test measures the path from the **controller host or container** to
Cloudflare. It is useful when that host shares the WAN path you care about, but
it is not a router-native test.

Read-only accounts can inspect the plan and history. Starting or cancelling a
test requires the **Operator**, **Admin**, or **Owner** role.

::: warning Bandwidth and privacy impact
One completed attempt transfers approximately 15 MiB—10 MiB down and 5 MiB
up—is bounded to 30 seconds, and can temporarily saturate a slower WAN. The
controller's public IP and test requests are visible to Cloudflare.
:::

1. Open **Dashboard**.
2. Open the impact and consent details and review the exact endpoint, limits,
   controller-host vantage point, and data-use disclosure.
3. Select **Run speed test**. In v0.1.3 this action is the explicit,
   plan-bound acknowledgement and starts the test immediately.
4. Leave the Dashboard open to watch progress.

The result can include download, upload, idle latency, and idle jitter. Loaded
latency and loaded jitter are not measured in v0.1.3. The controller retains
the newest three terminal attempts, including failed or cancelled attempts, so
a failure does not disappear from history.

### Verify the result

- Confirm the result says **Completed** and has a finish time.
- Compare the chart bar with the exact result table.
- Check whether the controller host uses the same uplink, VPN, container
  network, or traffic policy as the device path you intended to evaluate.
- Compare against live traffic. A speed test run while the network is busy is
  evidence of the combined load, not an unloaded line rate.

### Cancel or recover

Use **Cancel** while a test is running. The terminal history should report the
cancelled outcome. If the UI disconnects, reopen the Dashboard; the controller
owns the job and exposes its current or terminal state after reconnecting.

## Use topology and event summaries

The Dashboard includes a compact topology view and recent warning/error list.

- Open **Topology** for confidence, medium, VLAN, history, and full source-gap
  controls.
- Open **Logs** when a warning needs its complete details or surrounding audit
  events.
- Open the named **Device** when the event points to capability, collection,
  or management overhead.

## A practical investigation sequence

When the Dashboard looks unhealthy:

1. Confirm whether the data is fresh, stale, partial, or unavailable.
2. Compare the affected device's online state and last-seen time.
3. Check the Gateway path and WAN source message.
4. Correlate traffic, latency, and loss across the same time range.
5. Review recent warnings and errors.
6. Open **Topology** for a path or placement change.
7. Run a speed test only if its controller-host vantage and bandwidth impact
   answer the remaining question.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely explanation | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| Internet health is unavailable | No managed Gateway, stale/incomplete kernel-route and interface evidence, failed poll, or unsupported route shape | Open the Gateway device and review the default-route source gap. Correct the route or transport/permission problem, then allow the next network/topology cycle; refresh the ACL only when the UI names a missing permission |
| Wireless count is incomplete | One or more AP-function devices lack fresh station evidence | Open **Devices**, find the named coverage gaps, and wait for or troubleshoot their focused poll |
| Charts show gaps | The bucket had no valid samples; the controller restarted, device was unreachable, or a source failed | Use the accessible table and Logs; do not interpret the gap as zero |
| Speed test is much slower than expected | Container/VPN path, concurrent traffic, controller-host limits, or shared WAN saturation | Verify the host path and repeat during a controlled quiet window only if another 15 MiB test is acceptable |
| Speed test fails immediately | Controller cannot reach the Cloudflare endpoints or the job was refused by current state | Check controller logs, DNS/HTTPS egress, and whether another test is active |
| A device is online but WAN health is missing | Device management reachability and Gateway Internet evidence are separate | Verify the Gateway function, default route source, and probe result on that device |
| PPPoE WAN traffic is unavailable | The kernel L3 route device has no matching counter series, cannot map to exactly one active logical interface, or the composite source failed | Compare the main-table route with OpenWrt interface state, correct the inconsistency, and wait for the next network/topology cycle; do not rename interfaces as a workaround |
| Main-table route is healthy but a policy-routed path differs | v0.1.3 does not model policy routing, `mwan3`, per-uplink health, or manual WAN selection | Treat the Dashboard path as main-table evidence only and use the policy/failover system's own status for that traffic |
